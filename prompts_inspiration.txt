The glass of her bedroom window shattered inwards, and a masked man was on her before she could even scream. He clamped a hand over her mouth, his other hand ripping at her nightgown as he whispered, "Be quiet and I might let you live."
She thought the parking garage was empty, but a hand shot out from behind a concrete pillar and grabbed her. He slammed her against her own car, his voice a low growl, "You're not going anywhere tonight."
The chemical-soaked rag was pressed over her mouth and nose before she could react, the world fading to black. She woke up bound to a bed in a dark basement, her captor standing over her, unbuckling his belt.
She felt a prick in her neck while dancing in the crowded club, and her legs suddenly felt like lead. A man she didn't know caught her as she stumbled, whispering, "Don't worry, I'll take care of you," as he led her out the back door.
He'd been hiding in the back seat of her car, and the moment she locked the doors he lunged forward, pressing a knife to her throat. "Drive to the woods," he hissed, "and don't even think about screaming."
The elevator stopped between floors with a lurch, and the only other man inside turned to her with a chilling smile. "Looks like we have some time to get acquainted," he said, pressing the emergency stop button.
She was jogging on the isolated park trail when he tackled her from the bushes, dragging her deeper into the woods. He pinned her to the ground and said, "Shouldn't have come out here all alone."
The home invasion was swift and silent, and she found herself tied to a chair in her own living room. The leader of the crew knelt before her and said, "My men can have the valuables. I'll take you."
He followed her from the bar, cornering her in the narrow alleyway behind her apartment building. "I saw you looking at me," he sneered, pressing her against the cold brick. "Now you're going to give me what I want."
She woke to the weight of a body on top of her in her own bed, a stranger's hand silencing her muffled cry. "I've been watching you for weeks," he whispered into her ear. "It's time I finally had you."
The delivery man forced his way through the door after she signed for the package, the door clicking shut behind him. "One more delivery to make," he said, his eyes roaming over her body.
Stranded on the side of the road with a flat tire, she gratefully accepted a ride from a passing truck driver. But instead of driving towards town, he turned down a deserted dirt road and said, "The price of the ride just went up."
Her blind date seemed nice enough at dinner, but in the car he locked the doors and his demeanor changed completely. "I think you owe me a bit more than a handshake for that expensive meal," he said, climbing over the center console.
She was closing up the shop for the night when he slipped in just before she could lock the door. "We're having a private sale tonight," he announced, flipping the sign to 'Closed' and advancing on her.
He grabbed her wrist in the crowded subway car, pulling her into a deserted corridor at the next stop. He shoved her against the grimy tile wall and said, "You and I are going to miss the next train."
The fake police officer pulled her over on a lonely stretch of highway, ordering her out of the car. Instead of asking for her license, he pushed her against the hood and said, "There's a different kind of fine you're going to pay tonight."
She was house-sitting in a remote mansion when she realized the caretaker wasn't just there to maintain the grounds. He cornered her in the library, saying, "The master is away, which means I'm in charge now."
As a librarian shelving books in a deserted aisle after hours, she was cornered by a large figure. "I've been waiting for you to be alone," he growled, trapping her between the shelves.
He overpowered her in the laundromat, the rumble of the machines covering her initial struggles. He pushed her back into the small, windowless storage room and said, "No one can hear you in here."
During a city-wide blackout, he broke into her apartment through an unlocked window. "So dark," he whispered from right behind her, "no one will see a thing."
She was exploring the abandoned hospital on a dare when a squatter emerged from the shadows. "You trespassed in my home," he said, backing her into a decaying operating room. "Now you pay rent."
He grabbed her on her way to the communal bathroom in the youth hostel, dragging her into his own dorm room. "This is what you get for walking around like that," he hissed, throwing her onto the bottom bunk.
The handsome stranger at the masquerade ball led her out to the moonlit garden for a dance. But once they were hidden by the hedges, he pushed her against a statue and said, "Now for the real party."
He offered to help her carry her groceries up to her apartment, but once inside, he kicked the door shut. "Such a nice place," he said, dropping the bags and turning on her. "I think I'll stay a while."
While swimming alone at the lake, he emerged from the water right in front of her, blocking her way to the shore. "Looks like you're caught," he said, grabbing her and pulling her back into the deep water.
The storm knocked out the power at the isolated motel, and the night manager used his master key to enter her room. "Just making sure all the guests are safe," he said with a predatory grin, his silhouette filling the doorway.
She was on a camping trip when a rugged mountain man stumbled into her site, claiming to be lost. He then disabled her phone and cornered her in the tent, saying, "Looks like you're my new survival partner."
Her taxi driver took a wrong turn into an industrial park, stopping the car in a desolate loading bay. "The meter's off now," he said, turning around in his seat with a terrifying look in his eyes.
She was working late at the office, the only one on her floor, when the security guard came in. "Just doing my rounds," he said, locking the office door behind him. "And I've found something I want."
He pulled her off the street and into the back of a van in a swift, brutal motion. Inside, she saw two other men as the doors slammed shut, the leader saying, "Welcome to your new life."
At a crowded concert, she was pulled into the mosh pit, only to be passed over the crowd and into the hands of the band's roadies backstage. The lead roadie caught her and said, "The band likes a special encore after the show."
The plumber finished his work, but then lingered, blocking her exit from the small bathroom. "There's one more pipe I need to check," he said, his gaze dropping down her body.
She was a journalist investigating a derelict ship, when a man who had been hiding onboard trapped her in the captain's quarters. "You found my hideout," he grunted, "so I guess you're my treasure now."
Posing as a census taker, he gained entry to her home, but once the door was closed, he dropped the clipboard. "Alright, let's get to the real questions," he said, advancing on her slowly.
She was sunbathing on a secluded beach when he approached, his shadow falling over her. "This is a private beach," he said, "and you're trespassing. I'm the one who doles out the punishment here."
During a fire drill, he herded her down a different stairwell, away from the crowds, and into a sub-basement. "False alarm," he said, locking the heavy door behind them. "But this is a real emergency for you."
He cornered her in the walk-in freezer of the restaurant where she worked. "It's cold in here," he said, his breath fogging in the air. "I know a way we can warm up."
She was a lone tourist in a foreign city, lost in a maze of backstreets, when he offered to help. He led her into a dead-end courtyard and said, "The price for a guide is very high around here."
The handsome hitchhiker she picked up suddenly produced a weapon once they were miles from anywhere. "Pull over here," he commanded. "The ride's not over yet."
He worked for the moving company, the last one in her old, empty apartment. "Looks like they forgot one thing," he said after the truck pulled away, turning the key in the lock. "You."
As a new intern, she was asked to retrieve a file from the archives, a dusty, isolated basement. Her manager followed her down and locked the door, saying, "Time for your real orientation."
He was her stalker, and she finally came face-to-face with him when he disabled her car in an underground tunnel. "Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide," he whispered, emerging from the gloom. "I finally have you."
A sudden fog rolled in on the boardwalk, and in the confusion, he grabbed her and pulled her under the pier. "Perfect cover," he muttered, pushing her down into the damp sand.
The handyman fixed her fuse box but then intentionally cut the power to the whole house. In the sudden darkness, he grabbed her and said, "Now, about my payment..."
She was a bridesmaid who went to get some air in the venue's garden, where a groomsman followed her. "You look too good to be alone tonight," he slurred, pushing her into the high hedges.
The amusement park was closing when he dragged her into the dark, winding tunnel of a water ride that had been shut down. "This ride's not open to the public," he said, his voice echoing in the darkness. "It's just for you and me."
He was a disgruntled former employee who came back to the office after everyone else had left for the holiday weekend. He found her working late and said, "The company took everything from me. Now I'm taking something back."
She was a real estate agent showing a remote, empty house when the 'client' locked the front door. "I'm not interested in the house," he said, pocketing the key. "I'm interested in you."
During a historical reenactment battle, he "captured" her and dragged her off the field and into the woods. "The battle's over," he panted, throwing her to the ground. "And you're my spoils."
She fell through rotten floorboards in an old barn, landing in a hidden cellar where a hermit had been living. He loomed over her injured form and grunted, "Looks like God sent me a gift."
After another fight where he twisted her words, he backed her against the wall, his voice deceptively soft. "You're just being hysterical and confused," he murmured. "Let me show you what you really want."
She tried to end the toxic relationship, but he grabbed her arm, his eyes welling with tears. "If you leave me, I'll have nothing left to live for," he whispered brokenly. "Please, just show me you still love me, just this once."
He had systematically cut her off from all her friends, until he was the only person she had left. "See? No one else cares about you," he said, pulling her close. "You're lucky you have me to take care of you."
He "saved" her from a staged mugging, and now he was in her apartment, acting like a hero. "I protected you," he said, blocking her path to the door. "Don't you think you owe me a proper thank you?"
"You're so lucky I put up with you, no one else ever would," he said, a familiar refrain that always chipped away at her confidence. He pushed her back onto the bed, adding, "Now be a good girl and prove you're worth the trouble."
The therapist had been grooming her for months, blurring the lines between patient and confidante. "To break through your trauma, you need to fully trust me and surrender control," he said in his soothing voice, his hand moving to her knee.
"If you really loved me, you'd do this for me," he said, the ultimate emotional blackmail. "Prove it. Prove that I mean more to you than your own silly inhibitions."
He constantly "forgot" his abusive episodes, making her feel like she was crazy for bringing them up. "I would never hurt you, you must have dreamt it," he said, his hands beginning to roam. "You're just stressed. Let me help you relax."
He held up two different dresses, both of which she'd sworn she'd never seen before. "You bought these last week, remember?" he said with a patient smile. "Your memory is getting so bad. It's a good thing I'm here to think for you."
After a public humiliation he orchestrated, he comforted her in private, holding her while she sobbed. "I'm the only one who will ever stand by you," he whispered, his comfort slowly turning possessive. "Let me take care of you tonight."
He intercepted a call from her sister, then told her nobody had called all day. "They've all forgotten you," he said with faux sympathy. "But I'm still here. I'll always be here for you."
"You're always so tense and frigid. It's no wonder you have no friends," he critiqued, his words like daggers. "Maybe if you just loosened up and gave me what I need, you'd be a more likeable person."
Her ex-boyfriend showed up at her door, looking thin and pale. "I haven't eaten since you left me," he lied, leaning against the doorframe. "Just let me stay for one night. Let me feel close to you again."
"You're nothing without me," he stated as if it were fact, after systematically sabotaging her job interview. "Your only value is what you can provide for me, right here in this bedroom."
He convinced her that her panic attacks were just attempts to manipulate him. "You're not having an attack, you're just trying to get out of this," he said calmly, continuing to undress her. "Stop the theatrics."
"Remember that secret you told me? The one that would destroy your family?" he asked conversationally. "I need you to be very accommodating tonight if you want it to stay a secret."
He would be incredibly romantic and loving for a week, then cruel and distant the next, a cycle that left her desperate for his affection. During a "good" phase, he'd murmur, "Show me how much you missed me. Show me how much you need this."
He convinced her she was a bad mother and that he was the only thing standing between her and losing her children. "If you want to stay in their lives," he said one evening, "you'll come to my bed and you won't complain."
"All my exes loved doing this. You're the only one who's so difficult," he complained, making her feel inadequate and abnormal. "Just try to be normal for once and give me what I want."
He had her so convinced of her own incompetence that she relied on him for everything. "You can't even manage your own life," he scoffed. "So just let me manage your body for a little while."
He "allowed" her to see a friend, then spent the next day telling her all the "bad things" the friend supposedly said about her. "I'm the only one who truly has your back," he concluded, pulling her into a possessive embrace. "Now thank me properly."
After she failed at a task, he'd comfort her in a patronizing way. "Oh, you poor thing, you can't do anything right, can you?" he'd coo. "Don't worry your pretty little head. Just focus on pleasing me."
He'd constantly rewrite their history to suit his narrative. "You begged me for this on our first date, remember?" he said, ignoring her protests. "You were so desperate for me. Let's pretend it's the first time again."
He used her deepest fear—being abandoned—as his primary weapon. "If you don't do this, I'll walk out that door and you will never see me again," he threatened, his hand on the doorknob. "Your choice."
"You're misinterpreting things again. I wasn't flirting with her, I was just being polite," he said, dismissing her valid concerns. "You're so paranoid. Come here and let me remind you who you belong to."
He set up an elaborate, romantic evening, a rare occurrence that made her feel hopeful. But when she resisted his advances, his face darkened. "I did all this for you," he said, his voice dangerously low. "You're not going to be ungrateful, are you?"
He convinced her that her natural desires were shameful and disgusting. "You should be glad I'm willing to touch you at all," he'd say. "Now stop complaining and let me."
He played the victim constantly, making every issue her fault. "My life is so hard, and you're the only good thing in it," he sighed, guilt-tripping her. "Can't you just give me this one thing to make it better?"
"You're being irrational. Your feelings aren't valid," the psychologist said, twisting her trauma into a pathology. "We need to engage in exposure therapy, where you cede control to a trusted authority. Me."
He would give her the silent treatment for days until she was desperate for any interaction. When he finally spoke, it would be a simple command: "Bedroom. Now."
"A good wife submits to her husband's needs," he said, framing his demands as her marital duty. "It's not a choice, it's your role. Now fulfill it."
He'd praise her intelligence when she agreed with him, but call her stupid when she resisted. "Don't be an idiot," he said, pushing her towards the bed. "You know this is what's best for both of us."
After he broke one of her prized possessions "by accident," he used her grief as an opening. "I'll buy you a new one," he promised, stroking her back. "Just let me make it up to you right now."
He would subtly insult her in front of others, then deny it in private, making her seem crazy. "They all think you're unstable," he'd whisper later. "Prove to me you're not. Be loving, right now."
"You owe me. You'll never find another man who would invest so much in someone as broken as you," he said, his voice cold and clinical. "Consider this a down payment on your emotional debt."
He would start an argument over nothing, escalating until she was emotionally exhausted and terrified. Then, he'd suddenly switch to being loving, saying, "Let's not fight. Let's just make up."
"I know you better than you know yourself," he insisted, dismissing her protests. "Your mouth says no, but your body wants me. I'll listen to your body."
He controlled all the finances, giving her an "allowance" she had to justify. "You want money for groceries?" he'd ask. "First, come and earn it."
He would describe her as "frigid" and "broken" to their mutual friends, isolating her socially. "They all know how you are," he'd say. "I'm the only one willing to fix you. Let's start now."
He would wake her up in the middle of the night, disoriented and vulnerable. "You were having a nightmare," he'd lie, pulling her close. "Let me hold you. Let me make it better."
He'd compare her unfavorably to his ex-partner constantly. "At least she knew how to please a man," he'd sigh. "Why don't you show me you can be better than her?"
"This is for your own good. You need this to feel normal," he'd say, pathologizing her sexuality. "Trust me, I know what you need."
He'd tell her elaborate stories of how people were plotting against her, making him her only ally. "It's us against the world," he'd say, creating a paranoid bubble. "We have to stick together, in every way."
After a minor mistake on her part, he would blow it out of proportion until she felt worthless. "You are so useless," he'd say. "At least try to be useful in one way. Come here."
He would feign helplessness, pretending to be too drunk or sick to manage on his own. "Help me get to bed," he'd slur, then once there, he'd pull her down. "Stay. Take care of me."
"You enjoyed it last time, don't lie to me," he'd insist, rewriting her memory of a previous coerced encounter. "Your body doesn't lie. Let's do it again."
He would move her things, then claim she was losing them, eroding her sense of control. "You're so scattered," he'd say with a chuckle. "Good thing you have me to keep you grounded."
He had convinced her that he was intellectually and morally superior in every way. "Your simple morals don't apply to a situation this complex," he explained. "Just submit to my judgment. In all things."
"If you don't, I'll tell everyone what you did in college," he threatened, bringing up an old mistake. "So, what's it going to be? A few minutes of your time, or a lifetime of shame?"
He'd create a high-stress situation, then present himself as the calming influence. "Everything is falling apart," he'd say. "Let's just forget the world for a while. Let me make you forget."
The sorcerer finished painting the glowing rune on her back, its heat sinking into her skin. "This mark binds you to my will," he said, his voice echoing with power. "And my first will is for you to come to my bed."
The vampire held her chin, forcing her to look at the two small punctures on her neck in the mirror. "My blood is in your veins now," he purred. "You feel the desire, the need. You cannot deny your new master."
After drinking the wine the Fae lord offered, a hazy fog enveloped her mind, making her feel warm and compliant. "A simple love potion," he said with a cruel smile. "Now you will be the perfect, willing bride."
The demon she'd summoned for power laughed, the contract burning into the air before them. "You asked for knowledge, and I have given it," it boomed. "The price, as stated in the fine print, is your vessel, whenever I desire it."
A priestess had declared her the chosen one, destined to be the Earthly Bride for the Serpent God. The high priest approached her on the altar and said, "It is a great honor. You must submit to the god's will, which I will now enact."
The geas was absolute; a magical command she was forced to obey or suffer agonizing pain. His order was simple and direct: "You will warm my bed every night until I release you. Do not disobey."
She put on the beautiful silver necklace he gave her, but it immediately grew cold and clamped around her throat. "An enslavement collar," he explained calmly. "It compels total obedience. Now, kneel."
He held the small, ugly doll that looked just like her, and when he pressed a pin into its leg, a sharp pain shot through hers. "Voodoo is so direct," he said. "Do exactly as I say, or the next pin goes somewhere much worse."
She was possessed by a spirit he controlled, her own body no longer her own. Through her own lips, she heard his voice say, "She can see and feel everything, but it is my hand, not hers, that will undress her for you."
The psychic's voice echoed in her head, a violation more intimate than any touch, crushing her own thoughts. You will not fight me, the voice commanded. You will walk to the bedroom and you will welcome me.
"This soulbond is unbreakable," the elf warrior said, the glowing mark on his hand mirroring her own. "Our souls crave union. Your body knows this, even if your mind is too stubborn to admit it."
She was a werewolf, and he was the pack's true Alpha. When he used his Alpha command, her body betrayed her, forcing her to her knees in submission. "Your place is at my feet," he growled. "And then in my bed."
The magical tattoo was supposed to be for protection, but now it spread across her skin like black fire, responding to his commands. "The tattoo wants its master," he said. "And it will make you obey."
She was trapped in a dreamscape of his design, a world where he was god. "In here, you have no free will," he said, his form shifting and towering over her. "You are merely a plaything for my amusement."
The djinn she'd freed from the lamp grinned. "You have your three wishes," he said, "but you forgot to wish for your freedom from me. Now you will serve me for a millennium."
"Your true name gives me power over you," the Fae prince whispered, his voice like winter chimes. "And I command you, by the name your mother gave you, to be my consort, tonight and forever."
The oracle had proclaimed that only a union between them could save the kingdom from the coming plague. "It is destiny, not desire," he said grimly, pulling her towards the ceremonial bed. "We must do our duty."
He held a lock of her hair, twisting it around a candle flame, and she felt a burning heat inside her. "A simple sympathy charm," the warlock sneered. "Whatever I desire, you will feel. And I desire you to burn for me."
She was haunted by a ghost who could physically interact with her, its cold touch a constant presence. "You cannot escape me," it whispered from the darkness of her room. "I will have the life I was denied, through you."
The magical harp he played filled her with an irresistible urge to please him. Every note stripped away another layer of her defiance, until all she wanted was his approval. "Such sweet music," he said. "It makes you so compliant."
As a nature spirit, she was bound to her sacred grove, and he had taken it over with dark magic. "Your life force is tied to this place," he said, placing a corrupted hand on the heart-tree. "And I am its master. That means I am your master."
The alchemical elixir didn't create love, but apathy, draining her of all will to resist. "It's easier to just let it happen, isn't it?" he asked, leading her limp form to the couch.
She was a valkyrie, and he had stolen her feathered cloak, rendering her powerless and trapped in the mortal realm. "You will not fly again until I am satisfied," he said, holding the cloak just out of reach. "And I am a man of great appetites."
The ancient artifact she'd unearthed was a mind-control crown, and he had just placed it on his own head. His first command came as a thought directly into her mind: Undress.
"This is not a request," the alien commander said, his telepathic voice brooking no argument. "The biological imperative of our species demands this union. Your compliance is required for survival."
The water from the enchanted spring was supposed to heal her, but it had bound her to the spring's guardian. "You drank of my life force," he said. "Now you will replenish me."
The shadow demon that was bonded to him detached from the wall, its form solidifying as it wrapped around her, holding her immobile. "He can't touch you," his master said, "but he can hold you for me."
He read from the dark tome, and the words summoned invisible chains that wrapped around her limbs, forcing her into a kneeling position. "The spell of subjugation," he announced. "The first of many we will practice tonight."
She was a mermaid captured by a sailor who knew the secret to keeping her in human form. "As long as I have your pearl," he said, holding the glowing orb, "your legs will not fail you, and you will do exactly as I command."
The cursed mirror showed not her reflection, but a version of her that was seductive and utterly obedient. Her reflection stepped out of the mirror, smiled at her terrified real self, and took the man's hand.
"The mating fever is upon you," the shifter clan leader observed as she trembled with a preternatural heat. "As the Alpha, it is my right and duty to sate it for you. You will not resist."
The witch had brewed a potion of terror, making her see him as her only safe harbor in a world of monsters. She clung to him, sobbing, and he whispered, "That's right. Stick close to me. I'm the only one who can protect you."
He completed the ritual, and now their life forces were linked. "If I feel pain, you feel pain," he explained, holding a knife to his own palm. "So I suggest you don't do anything to displease me tonight."
The golem he created was sworn to protect him and obey his every command. He pointed at her and ordered the towering clay figure, "Bring her to my chambers. Do not let her struggle."
As a powerful empath, he didn't control her mind, but her emotions. He flooded her with feelings of overwhelming adoration and desire, short-circuiting her ability to think critically. "You feel that, don't you?" he whispered. "That's how you truly feel about me."
The Seer had a vision of her in his bed, and he considered it a prophecy that must be fulfilled. "It is the will of the cosmos," he said, his eyes glowing. "We do not have a choice."
The cursed armor she wore in the tournament was now fused to her skin, and he held the key to unlock it. "You'll be trapped in that steel forever," he said, "unless you agree to my terms for the key."
He was a god of revelry, and his mere presence inspired a Bacchic frenzy in mortals. She fought the intoxicating madness, but her body wanted to dance, to drink, to shed all inhibition for him. "Don't fight it," he laughed. "Give in."
The ring he slipped on her finger was a betrothal ring from the Underworld, binding her to him. "You are now Queen of the Damned," he said. "It's time for your coronation."
He was a powerful illusionist who had trapped her in a fantasy where she was a willing slave and he was her beloved master. While she was lost in the beautiful dream, he took advantage of her real, captive body.
"This wand compels the truth," he said, pointing it at her. "Tell me you desire me." When she tried to say no, the magic twisted her words, and she heard herself whisper, "I desire you." He smiled. "I knew it."
She was a dryad, and he had planted a seed of dark wood in her heart-tree. "I control the tree now," he said, as she felt a deep sickness well within her. "And through it, I control you. You will do anything to make it healthy again."
The alien symbiote he'd forced on her needed a specific hormone produced during arousal to survive. "If you want to live," he said coldly, "you'll have to keep our guest fed."
He had trapped her soul in a small crystal, leaving her body an empty but living husk. "I'll keep this safe," he said, holding the crystal up to the light. "While you and I get to know each other."
The rune carved into the door of her room made it impossible for her to leave unless she felt genuine desire for him. "The lock only opens for passion," he explained. "So you can either learn to want me, or you can starve in here."
He was a time mage, and he trapped her in a one-minute loop that would only break when she submitted. After what felt like a thousand identical minutes of her refusing, her will finally began to crack.
The Siren's song didn't lure men to their deaths, but ensnared women for her master. She found herself inexplicably walking towards the dark cove, drawn by a beautiful voice, into the arms of the waiting pirate captain.
"I am a dream eater," he explained, as she lay paralyzed in her bed. "I can give you beautiful dreams for the rest of your life... or I can give you nightmares. The price is your body while you sleep."
He was a chaos mage, and with a snap of his fingers, he altered reality so that they had been happily married for ten years. She was left reeling with a decade of false memories, a wedding ring on her finger, and a "husband" who wanted to celebrate their anniversary.
The magical ink of the slave tattoo was still fresh on her shoulder. "It connects you to my will," her new master said, tracing its design. "Right now, it is telling you to be a very, very good girl for me."
"This is a private, after-hours performance review, Lieutenant," the commanding officer said, closing and locking his office door. "Your career advancement depends heavily on your... flexibility."
The powerful CEO cornered the new intern by the empty coffee machine late at night. "Ambition is a wonderful quality," he said, his hand sliding down her back. "Show me just how ambitious you really are."
"Your grade in my class is borderline," the professor said, leaning over her desk during his office hours. "However, there is an opportunity for some... intensive extra credit that we could discuss."
The prison guard unlocked her cell door long after lockdown. "I can make your life in here very easy, or very hard," he whispered. "Let's start with easy."
"As your king, your pleasure is secondary to mine," he stated, dismissing her ladies-in-waiting with a wave of his hand. "Your duty is to the crown, and tonight, I am the crown."
"This is a highly experimental and undocumented therapy," the chief physician explained, locking the examination room door. "Your consent is merely a formality for a treatment this vital."
The cult leader gathered his female followers, his gaze settling on her. "The Prophet has a divine need tonight," he announced to the room, "and has chosen this vessel to receive his blessing."
Her parole officer sat across from her in the small, grim office, tapping her file. "One failed drug test and you go back inside for five years," he said, then leaned forward. "Or, you could pass a private inspection with me, right now."
"On my ship, my word is law," the captain said, cornering her in his private quarters on the long voyage. "And I command you to entertain me."
The judge called her into his chambers after the court had cleared, her case file in his hand. "A verdict of this magnitude requires careful, private deliberation," he said, locking the door. "And your full cooperation."
"You want to make partner at this firm, don't you?" the senior partner asked, closing the blinds in his penthouse office. "Consider this the final, most important part of your interview."
The drill sergeant found her cleaning the barracks latrine alone as punishment. "You want to get off this detail?" he growled. "There's another way to show me you've learned your lesson."
As the new governess, she was summoned to the lord's study late one evening. "Your duties extend beyond the children," he informed her, pouring two glasses of brandy. "You are here to serve the entire household, starting with its master."

The slum's crime boss offered her family protection from rival gangs. "Protection isn't free," he said, cornering her in the market. "You will be my payment."
She signed a contract to be a surrogate mother for a wealthy, mysterious man. The contract specified "natural insemination," and he arrived at her door to oversee the process personally. "It's time to uphold your end of the bargain," he said.
The man who paid her college tuition showed up at her dorm room. "I've invested a lot in your future," he said, stepping inside. "It's time you showed me a return on that investment."
Her car was repossessed, and she went to the lot owner to beg for it back. "I'll waive the fees," he offered, "if you'll come into the back office and take care of some... paperwork."
The journalist had uncovered a secret that could save her town, but the powerful man she needed to expose had found her first. "Publish that story, and I'll release these photos of your sister," he threatened. "Or keep quiet, and become my private little reporter."
He held the only evidence that could clear her name for a crime she didn't commit. "I want to help you," he said, dangling the USB drive. "But my help comes at a price. A very intimate price."
In the post-economic collapse city, she tried to barter for food with her last piece of jewelry. The trader pushed it back. "This is worthless," he said. "But you... you are not. One night with me gets your family food for a week."
The owner of the company town also owned her house, her credit at the store, and her job. "I see by my ledger that you are deeply in my debt," he said, cornering her. "We will begin payments tonight."
She was an actress whose career was ruined by a scandal he started. "I can make you a star again," he offered. "All you have to do is be my star, and mine alone."
The IRS agent auditing her found "serious irregularities." "This could mean years in prison and crippling fines," he said, closing her file. "Or we could find a way to amend the records, if you're willing to be... creative."
Her family sold her into indentured servitude to a spice merchant on a remote trading post. "Your contract binds you to me for ten years," he said on her first night. "Your duties start now."
The only way to get a visa out of the war-torn country was through a corrupt embassy official. "The processing fee is very steep," he said, looking her up and down. "But I do accept other forms of currency."
She'd been caught shoplifting, and the store's security manager took her to his office instead of calling the police. "I think we can keep this off your record," he said, locking the door. "For a price."
The ruthless developer bought her apartment building and was forcing everyone out. "I'll let you stay," he told her in a private meeting. "But you'll have to provide some... special services in lieu of rent."
To get her brother out of jail, she had to borrow money from a crime syndicate. The enforcer came to collect the first payment. "The boss doesn't want money," he said. "He wants you."
"Your scholarship to this music conservatory is sponsored by me, personally," the wealthy benefactor reminded her. "And I require a private concert, whenever I ask. The first is tonight."
"The alliance depends on this union," her father said grimly, presenting the cruel-looking nobleman who was to be her husband. "You will marry him, and you will give him an heir. Our family's survival is in your hands."
The head of the rival mafia family looked at her across the table after the peace was brokered. "The deal is sealed with a marriage," he announced. "She is mine now. Take her to my room."
"You have shamed this family," her grandfather, the clan patriarch, thundered. "You will restore our honor by accepting the proposal of Lord Valerius. Tonight, you will prove your obedience to him."
Her older brother, now head of the family, sold her into marriage to settle his gambling debts. Her new husband unlaced her gown and said, "I've paid a steep price for you. I expect to get my money's worth."
"I am your older stepbrother now, and while father is away, I am in charge," he said, cornering her in the hallway. "And I say it's time you learned to respect the new man of the house."
To save their ancestral home, her parents promised her to the cold, wealthy banker who held the deed. On their wedding night, he said, "Your family has sold you, piece by piece. Now let me inspect my purchase."
The family council had decreed she must produce an heir with the last male of a noble line. "It is your sacred duty," the Matriarch said. "Go to him now. Do not fail us."
Her stepfather cornered her in the kitchen late at night, his voice low and threatening. "Your mother thinks I'm a saint. If you want her to keep believing that, you'll do exactly as I say."
"As your legal guardian and uncle, I have decided on a suitable match for you," he announced, gesturing to a leering old business partner. "You will be wed tomorrow. Tonight, you will have a 'get acquainted' dinner, alone with him."
The king commanded her, his most loyal knight's daughter, to marry his depraved son to secure the line of succession. "Your father's loyalty must extend to his bloodline," the king said. "You will not refuse."
To atone for her brother's crime against a neighboring clan, she was given to them as a peace offering. The chieftain's son dragged her into his tent and said, "You are the price for the blood your brother spilled."
"You look so much like your mother when she was your age," her uncle murmured, his hand lingering on her shoulder. "She was always so good to me. It's time you learned to be as well."
Her foster father waited until her foster mother was out for the evening. "We give you a home, a bed, food," he said, blocking her bedroom door. "It's only fair you show a little gratitude."
"The family's reputation is at stake," her mother hissed, pushing her towards the powerful politician's hotel room. "Go in there and be charming. Do whatever it takes to fix this mess."
Her handsome, charming cousin had always been a little too familiar. At a family gathering, he pulled her into an empty room and said, "Come on, cousin. It's not like it's illegal. Keep it in the family."
The future of their company depended on a merger, which was conditional on her marrying the rival CEO. "Think of it as taking one for the team," her father said, his eyes avoiding hers.
Her much older husband, whom she was forced to marry for money, was dying. He summoned her to his bed. "I will leave you everything," he rasped, "if you give me a son before I go. We will start now, and we will not stop until you are with child."
"Your filial piety is your greatest virtue," her father said, a sinister edge to his voice. "And as your father, I command you to entertain my business associate for the evening. Do not disappoint me."
She was adopted into a powerful family with a dark secret. "Every woman in this family must go through the 'initiation'," her new "brother" explained, locking the door. "It's a tradition."
After her parents' death, her older brother took control of the estate and her life. "You live under my roof, you obey my rules," he said one night. "And my rule is that you will share my bed."
"Your dowry is insufficient," her new husband's father told her in private. "You will have to make up the deficit with personal service. To me."
The family required her to marry a man to maintain the purity of their magical bloodline. "Our power cannot be diluted," he said on their wedding night. "This is not about love, it is about legacy."
To repay a life debt her father owed, she was sent to serve the man who had saved him. "Your father offered me anything," the man said. "I chose you."
"I control your inheritance," her stepfather reminded her. "If you ever want to see a penny of your mother's money, you will be much, much nicer to me."
The powerful matriarch ordered her to seduce a rival to learn his secrets. "The fate of this family rests on your shoulders," she said. "Do not come back until you have what we need."
Her brother, the king, offered her as a bride to a savage warlord to stop an invasion. The warlord picked her up, threw her over his shoulder and grunted, "A fine prize. The truce will hold."
"In this family, we take care of our own," her father-in-law said, cornering her while her husband was away. "And right now, I have a need you're going to take care of."
She was forced to be a "companion" to her wealthy, elderly great-uncle. "Your job is to keep me company and see to all my needs," he wheezed, his wrinkled hand grabbing her arm. "All of them."
A family curse decreed that the youngest daughter must be given to the beast in the labyrinth. The guards pushed her through the great stone doors, which boomed shut behind her.
"You will marry my son, and you will be a dutiful wife," her future mother-in-law said, her voice like steel. "Your training in these duties begins tonight, with me, so you do not disappoint him."
Her twin brother, a degenerate prince, asked her to switch places with him for a political meeting. But the meeting was a trap, and she found herself locked in a room with a foreign envoy who said, "The prince promised me a night with his sister. I see he has delivered."
"The honor of this house demands blood for blood," her uncle said, tying her hands. "You will be given to the son of the man our family wronged, to do with as he pleases until the debt is paid."
After running away, she was found by her older brother and dragged back home. "You've been a very bad girl," he said, locking her in the cellar. "You will be punished until you learn to appreciate this family."
She was raised in a sheltered, isolated clan where the elders arranged all pairings. The elder who held her contract approached her on her wedding night and said, "Before you go to your husband, you must first be consecrated by the one who chose you."
"You must seduce the king's advisor and get him to change the decree," her mother instructed. "Use any means necessary. The survival of our lands depends on it."
Her stepfather held guardianship over her and her inheritance. "The courts gave me full authority over your person until you are 21," he reminded her. "That means your person is mine to command."
As part of a peace treaty, she was fostered with the former enemy clan. The clan head's son sneered at her, "You are a hostage, nothing more. A plaything to ensure your father's good behavior."
Her father's will stipulated that to inherit, she must marry the man he chose: his handsome, cruel business partner. "Your father wanted to make sure you were in good hands," her new fiancé said, cornering her after the reading. "Mine."
The family was part of a breeding program to create powerful psychics. "Your genetic match is optimal," the program director (who was also her uncle) stated. "The pairing will proceed as scheduled."
"I paid your mother a handsome bride-price for you," her new husband from a patriarchal tribe said. "You belong to me now, like my horse and my hounds. You will learn to obey."
Her wastrel brother had promised her to a loan shark to clear his name. The shark showed up at her door. "Your brother offered up his most precious jewel," he said, pushing his way inside. "I've come to collect."
She was the illegitimate daughter of a great lord, brought to the castle to be a companion for his trueborn daughter. But the lord himself had other plans, whispering, "You have my blood. You owe me your loyalty."
"A political marriage is not about affection," her husband, a prince, told her coldly on their wedding night. "It is about producing an heir. Let us get on with it."
Her older cousin was in charge of her "coming out" into society. "To be a successful debutante," he said during a private dance lesson, "you must learn how to please a man. Let the lessons begin."
The family required a virgin sacrifice to appease an ancient god, and she was the only one eligible. The priests led her to the altar, where the high priest said, "The god will take you now, through me."
Her older sister's powerful husband made a pass at her. "If you tell her," he threatened, "I will ruin your family. If you keep quiet and do as I ask, I will make you all rich."
Her family sent her to a convent to hide a scandal. The convent's benefactor, a depraved nobleman, had special "visitation rights." "The abbess knows," he told her. "She knows you are here for my pleasure."
To save her younger sister from a forced marriage, she offered to take her place. Her new husband smiled cruelly. "The selfless lamb," he mocked. "I will enjoy breaking you so much more."
The family patriarch was dying and wanted to ensure the bloodline continued. He ordered her to his bed, telling the horrified family, "It is my final right. I will plant the seed of the next generation myself."
"You will share your husband with your sister," the ruling matriarch of their polyamorous clan decreed. "It is our way. He will come to your bed tonight to welcome you into the marriage."
"You have been chosen by the Great Serpent God to be his earthly vessel," the high priest intoned, as acolytes disrobed her on the cold stone altar. "Prepare to receive his divinity."
The cult leader smiled benevolently at her, his voice washing over the mesmerized crowd. "To achieve true enlightenment, you must surrender the flesh," he said, taking her hand. "The first step of your journey will be with me, tonight."
"This is the final stage of your initiation into the Circle of Whispers," the robed master said, standing before her in the candlelit chamber. "You must prove your absolute loyalty by submitting your body and will to the order."
The oracle declared that her union with the victorious general was fated to save the city. "It is the will of the gods," the general said, his hands already on her. "We cannot defy destiny."
"To purge your sins of vanity and pride," the ascetic priest commanded, "you will perform penance. You will kneel before me and submit to humiliation until your soul is clean."
The gladiator who won the grand tournament had the right to claim any prize. He pointed his bloodied sword at her in the emperor's box and bellowed, "I claim her!"
As part of the sacred harvest festival, the "Harvest Queen" must give herself to the "Green Man" to ensure a bountiful crop. The masked man chosen this year cornered her by the bonfire. "It's for the good of the village," he whispered.
The secret society demanded a show of ultimate trust from its new female members. "You will surrender yourself completely to a senior member," the leader explained. "This is how we ensure there are no secrets between us."
"Your philosophy preaches the acceptance of all experiences without judgment," the charismatic sophist said, backing her into a corner. "Therefore, to deny this experience would be a betrayal of your own code."
The winner of the brutal cage fight was granted "victor's rights" over the loser's entourage. He strode over to her, the loser's manager, and said, "My prize. You're coming with me."
"This ritual requires a symbolic sacrifice of innocence," the witch explained, her voice hypnotic. "As my apprentice, you must be the one to offer it. To me."
The doomsday cult believed the world was ending tomorrow, and all earthly laws were void. The leader grabbed her arm, saying, "On our last night, we will indulge every desire as a final prayer!"
She was a "consecrated temple maiden," raised from birth to serve the pilgrims who came to the remote shrine. A wealthy patron arrived and chose her, saying, "I have made a generous donation. I am here for my blessing."
The warrior clan's tradition dictated that a captured enemy standard-bearer belonged to the warrior who captured them. "I took your flag," he growled, throwing her into his tent. "Now I take you."
"To become one with the hive mind, you must shed your selfish individuality," the telepathic collective's leader projected into her thoughts. "The process begins by surrendering your physical form for the collective's use."
The ancient tradition of "the guest's right" in the isolated tribe meant a visitor could demand anything from his host. The traveler visiting her family looked at her and said, "I demand her for the night."
In the nihilist commune, the only rule was "do what thou wilt." The commune's founder cornered her and said, "My will is to have you. To deny me is to impose a rule, and that is forbidden."
The annual "claiming day" allowed any unmarried man to challenge another for his betrothed. A brutal stranger won the duel for her hand and dragged her away, saying, "You're mine now."
"The sacred texts say the queen must be shared amongst the high council to ensure unity," the elder said, his colleagues nodding behind him. "It is a holy tradition, and you will not break it."
The ritual of blood-bonding required the two participants to share everything: thoughts, pain, and pleasure. Her partner in the forced ritual smiled cruelly. "Now you'll feel exactly what I want you to feel," he said.
The bacchanal was a religious frenzy of wine and dance, meant to honor the god of revelry. Caught up in the madness, she was pulled into the circle's center, where the high priest waited. "The god desires you!" he shouted over the drums.
To seal the peace treaty, the two tribes had to perform a "unity ritual." This involved the chieftain of one tribe taking the daughter of the other, in full view of both peoples, as a symbol of the new bond.
The 'Trial by Passion' was the final test for the paladin order. "You must prove you can endure temptation without falling," the grand master said, unfastening his robes. "Your test begins now."
In the matriarchal society, all men were property. The queen pointed at the handsome foreign captive and then at her daughter. "He is your new bed-slave," she announced. "Go, break him in."
"The machine requires a sacrifice of pure life force to power it," the techno-priest explained. "This energy is most potent when released during moments of extreme physical passion. Prepare the subject."
The "bride of the dragon" was a girl chosen every ten years to be left as a sacrifice. But the dragon was a shapeshifting man, who took his offering not to eat her, but to claim her as his mate.
The esoteric order believed that sacred knowledge could only be passed through the "exchange of vital fluids." The archivist, her teacher, locked the library door. "It is time for your first true lesson," he said.
She lost a "duel of wits" with a trickster god. "The terms of our wager were clear," he said with a grin. "Your mind lost. Now your body is my prize."
The "rite of purification" demanded she be cleansed by the village shaman before her wedding. "All worldly attachments must be burned away," the shaman chanted, his hands beginning to roam. "You must come to your husband pure."
The victorious gladiator was granted a single night with the Empress. The guards shoved her into the champion's chambers. "Your majesty," he grunted, covered in sand and blood. "I'm here to claim my reward."
The hedonist philosophy she'd been exploring had a dark side. "The pursuit of pleasure is the only moral good," her guru said. "And it would bring me great pleasure to have you. You wouldn't want to be immoral, would you?"
The "blood-letting" ritual was supposed to appease the war god. The captured priestess was tied to the altar as the enemy warlord approached with a ceremonial knife. "The god demands a sacrifice of blood and spirit," he said.
She was an anthropologist studying a remote tribe, and had accidentally broken a major taboo. "The spirits are angered," the chieftain said. "You must appease them by submitting to a cleansing ritual... with me."
The "Great Hunt" was a yearly tradition where the men hunted for a "sacred doe," a maiden chosen to run. The hunter who caught her could claim her for the season. He cornered her in a ravine. "The hunt is over," he panted.
The monastic order she joined practiced "mortification of the flesh" to achieve holiness. The abbot summoned her for a private session. "Your pride is your greatest sin," he said. "We will destroy it together."
The arena slaves were forced to fight to the death, but the owner sometimes offered a reprieve. "You can avoid the arena tomorrow," he told her, "if you entertain me in my villa tonight."
The " Choosing" was a ceremony where the clan's spirit-possessed oracle would pick a mate for the chieftain. The oracle's glazed eyes fell on her, and a raspy voice declared, "She will be the one."
To join the assassins' guild, she had to forsake all personal ties. The final test was to submit to the guild master, to prove she was no longer a person, but a tool. "A weapon does not have a will of its own," he said.
The ancient law of conquest stated that the victor could claim the wife of the man he defeated in single combat. After he killed her husband on the dueling field, he walked over to her and said, "Now for the spoils."
The fertility cult's main ritual involved the "plowing of the field," where the high priest would publicly bed the chosen maiden. "Rejoice," he told her. "You bring life to the people."
The tradition of "hospitality" in the desert kingdom was absolute. When the powerful sheikh visiting her family declared, "I desire your daughter for my entertainment tonight," her father had no choice but to hand her over.
The "Test of Submission" was required to gain access to the forbidden library. "You must prove you can be controlled," the ancient librarian said. "Knowledge is power, and we must be sure you will not abuse it."
The psionic academy's final exam was a mind-meld with the headmaster. "You must lower all your mental shields," he instructed. "And allow me full access to every part of you."
The "Culling Day" was a brutal tradition to keep the population strong. The weak were eliminated, and the strong could claim any of the survivors. The strongest warrior approached her. "You survived," he said. "You're mine."
The sacred vows of her order required her to "comfort any who are in pain." Her corrupt superior feigned a deep emotional agony. "My soul is in torment," he said, pulling her close. "Fulfill your vow. Comfort me."
The Day of Anarchy was a 24-hour period where all laws were suspended as a social pressure valve. A man who'd always coveted her from afar broke down her door. "No laws today," he said with a terrifying smile.
The "Oracle of the Flesh" received her visions through physical intimacy. A king seeking guidance on a coming war was brought to her chamber. "The gods will speak to me through your touch," she said in a trance-like state.
The "Ritual of Unburdening" forced participants to confess their darkest secrets and desires. After her confession, the leader said, "Now that your desires are known, the group will help you fulfill them, as is our custom."
She was a captured spy, and her interrogator was a high-ranking priest of a truth-worshipping cult. "Lies are a sin," he said. "We will purify you with truth, in mind and body, until you confess everything."
The "Championship" of the brutal, city-wide bloodsport granted the winner one boon from the ruling council. The champion, a scarred barbarian, pointed at the councilman's daughter and said, "I want her."
The warlord of the post-apocalyptic settlement looked down at her from his throne of scrap metal. "Your community wants water and medicine," he grunted. "The price is you. One week with me, and they get their supplies."
She was starving, and the grizzled trader in the ruined city was the only one with food. "I'll give you this can of meat," he said, holding it just out of reach. "But you'll have to trade me something for it. Something warm."
Trapped in a collapsed mine with her foreman, her leg was pinned under rubble. "I can get that rock off you," he said, his eyes glinting in the dark. "But you're going to have to make it worth my while."
She was the only fertile woman found in the colony ship's wreckage, and the grim leader of the survivors cornered her. "The future of humanity rests on you," he said, his voice flat and absolute. "We will begin repopulation tonight."
The hunter had been tracking her for days through the desolate wasteland. He finally cornered her in a cave and said, "The chase is over, little rabbit. Now comes the reward."
The alien who captured her offered her a simple choice: be experimented on by his scientists, or accept his personal "protection." "Become my consort," the alien commander proposed, "and I will ensure no other being on this ship lays a hand on you."
The only way to get the cure for the plague that was killing her sister was to ask the reclusive scientist who designed it. "My price is not money," he said, looking at her from across his lab. "I require a living test subject for my research on human intimacy. You."
Her group was out of water, and the only other survivor in the desert had a full canteen. "I'll give you a drink," he rasped, "for a taste of something else."
The leader of the mountain shelter took her aside as the blizzard raged outside. "We're low on rations," he said. "The men are getting restless. If you keep me happy, I'll make sure you and your family are the last to go hungry."
She was a prisoner of war, slated for execution at dawn. The enemy general visited her cell. "I can commute your sentence," he offered. "In exchange for your unconditional and permanent service in my private retinue."
On the 'ark' ship fleeing a dying Earth, the Captain held absolute authority. "Every passenger must contribute to the viability of the mission," he announced, his eyes on her. "Your contribution will be to morale. My morale."
Stranded on a deserted island, he was the only one who knew how to fish and build a fire. "If you want to eat tonight," he said, gesturing to the shelter he'd built, "you'll be sleeping in here with me."
In the zombie-infested city, she was cornered by a scavenger who had a working vehicle. "I can get you out of here," he said, "but the ride isn't free. You pay with the only thing you have left."
She was sold as a "blood bag" to a community of vampires to survive the apocalypse. The vampire who bought her contract said, "Your purpose is to feed me. But tonight, I have a different appetite."
The corrupt border guard caught her trying to sneak into the safe zone. "I can forget I ever saw you," he said, pushing her into the guard shack. "But you'll have to give me a reason to."
She was a stowaway on a long-haul freighter, discovered by a single crewman. "I can keep you hidden from the captain," he said, "if you give me a good reason to keep my mouth shut."
The only doctor in the plague-ridden quarantine zone held the last of the vaccine. "I'll give you a dose for your son," he said. "In exchange for a sample of your genetic material. The collection process is... specific."
As a 'pleasure slave' in the barbarian king's camp, she was given a choice: entertain the entire horde, or be claimed exclusively by the king himself. The king looked at her and said, "Choose."
She was trapped on a damaged space station with a single, hulking cyborg, and life support was failing. "My cybernetics can patch the system," he said, "but my organic parts have needs. See to them, and I'll save us both."
After the fall of society, she sought refuge in a fortified library run by a single, armed scholar. "Knowledge is not free," he said, bolting the door. "And neither is shelter. You will pay for your keep."
He rescued her from a pack of mutants, and now she owed him a life debt. "I saved you," he reminded her back at his fortified camp. "Your life belongs to me now. All of it."
In the underground bunker, the overseer controlled the food and water dispensers. "Your weekly ration has been approved," he said, cornering her. "But first, you'll need to pay the 'service fee'."
The brutal leader of the raider gang that destroyed her village found her hiding in the ruins. "Look what I found," he grinned, pulling her out. "A survivor. You'll make a fine new pet for my tent."
She was the only one who knew the location of the hidden oasis, and the dying caravan leader's men had captured her. "Tell us where the water is," he rasped, "or I will let my men take what they want from you until you beg to tell us."
To gain entry into the last remaining safe city on Earth, she had to pass an interview with the city's administrator. "We have more than enough people," he said coldly. "You must possess a unique skill to be of value. Show me yours."
In the middle of a brutal famine, he revealed a hidden stash of seeds. "I can feed this whole village for a year," he said to her. "But I want a wife. You."
She was shipwrecked and pulled from the water by a lone lighthouse keeper. "You're a long way from home," he said, locking the door at the top of the tower. "And you're not going anywhere."
The alien species that 'rescued' humanity from a cosmic disaster saw humans as pets. Her designated 'owner' patted her head. "You are a cute little thing," he said. "Now, come perform your duties."
She was captured by slavers, and a wealthy merchant was inspecting the new stock. He pointed at her and said, "I'll take this one. Have her cleaned and sent to my chambers immediately."
The only way to get passage on the last boat out of the flooded city was to bargain with its captain. "The boat is full," he said, "but for you... maybe we can squeeze one more in. If you're willing to share my cabin."
In the frozen north, she sought shelter with a reclusive trapper in his cabin. "Shelter and food have a price out here," he grunted, barring the door against the wind. "Pay it."
He was the only one in the fallout shelter with the code to the door. "Our time in here is almost up," he said. "If you want me to open that door for you, you'll spend our last night in here with me."
She was a refugee, and the man running the camp controlled the distribution of aid packages. "I see your name is not on the list for this week's shipment," he said. "Come to my tent later, and maybe I can fix that."
The brutal warrior who claimed her as a prize of war dragged her back to his village. "You are mine now," he said. "You will bear my sons and warm my bed. It is the law of conquest."
After a crash-landing on a primal planet, he, the ship's brutish engineer, was the only one who could fix the comms. "You want to get home?" he asked the ship's beautiful science officer. "Then get on your knees and convince me."
The fire that swept through the shanty town left her with nothing. The local strongman offered her a place in his compound. "I'll protect you," he said. "But my protection isn't free."
She was captured by a tribe of cannibals, but the chief found her too beautiful to eat. "You will be spared," he declared. "You will belong to me, instead."
The city was under siege, and starvation was rampant. A guard offered her a stolen loaf of bread. "I'll trade you this," he said, "for a few minutes of your time in that alley."
She was a deep-space prospector whose ship broke down, and her only hope was a signal from a lone mining outpost run by one man. "I'll give you the parts to fix your ship," he said. "After you've kept me company for a while. It gets lonely out here."
The tyrannical ruler of the domed city had declared a "fertility decree" to increase the population. She was assigned to him as a breeding partner. "It is your civic duty," the announcement read.
In the lawless frontier town, the Sheriff was the only law. "I could arrest you for vagrancy," he told her. "Or you could stay with me. I'm a lonely man."
He found her half-dead in the desert and nursed her back to health. "I saved your life," he said once she was strong again. "That life now belongs to me. Come to bed."
The alien gladiator was forced to fight in the pits for his human captors. After winning a major victory, he was granted one night with any female of his choosing. He pointed to the cruel overseer's daughter.
The resistance cell needed to use her as bait to trap an enemy commander. "You'll have to... distract him," the cell leader said, his eyes hard. "For the cause."
She was the sole survivor of a plague that made her immune. The warlord who found her saw her not as a cure, but as the ultimate prize. "A woman who cannot die," he mused. "The perfect queen for my new world."
The only way through the ghoul-infested swamp was with a guide. "The path is dangerous," the grizzled swamp-dweller said. "I'll keep you safe... if you keep me warm at night."
She was caught stealing water from the Baron's private well during a drought. "The punishment is death," he said. "Unless you can offer me a more... hydrating form of payment."
In a world where all women had gone sterile, she was miraculously pregnant. She was captured and brought before the last king on Earth. "You carry the hope of mankind," he said. "That hope belongs to me now."
The pirate crew mutinied, and she, the former captain's daughter, was part of the plunder. The new captain grinned at her. "The old captain's treasure is mine now," he said. "And that includes you."
He was the only one on the generation ship who knew how to operate the hydroponics bay. "If this crew wants to eat," he announced to the council while staring at her, "you'll meet my price. And my price is her."
The warlord of the post-apocalyptic settlement looked down at her from his throne of scrap metal. "Your community wants water and medicine," he grunted. "The price is you. One week with me, and they get their supplies."

The victorious general strode through the conquered palace and stopped before the defeated queen. "Your city is mine, your army is broken, and now, you are mine," he declared, pulling her from her throne.
After the battle, he found her tending the wounded, the last noble lady of the fallen fortress. "The battle is over," he said, wiping blood from his brow. "And you are my spoils of war."
As part of the surrender treaty, she, the chieftain's daughter, was given to the rival warlord as a peace-bride. "Let this union seal our truce," her father said, as the warlord dragged her away.
He was the conqueror, and the ancient law of 'prima nocta' gave him the right to bed any bride on her wedding night. He entered her chambers and dismissed her new husband, saying, "The king always comes first."
She was a captured spy, and the enemy intelligence officer had her strapped to a chair in a cold, dark room. "You can tell me the secrets," he said, leaning in close, "or we can try... more persuasive methods of extraction."
The knight defeated her champion in single combat for her hand. He strode over to her, lifted his visor and said, "By right of combat, you are now betrothed to me. The wedding is tonight."
The city fell, and the soldiers were let loose for three days of pillaging. A brutal captain kicked in her door. "The general said we could take whatever we wanted," he growled. "And I want you."
She was taken as a high-profile hostage to ensure her father, the king, would comply with the treaty. The prince holding her captive visited her gilded cage. "As long as you are here," he purred, "you will entertain me."
The conquering emperor demanded a tribute of the 100 most beautiful women from the vanquished nation. As she was paraded before him, he pointed at her. "This one," he said. "Send her to my tent."
He led the rebellion that overthrew the corrupt monarchy. He found the beautiful, cruel princess hiding in the servant's quarters. "Your reign is over," he sneered, pulling her to her feet. "Now you'll learn to serve."
As a camp follower, her survival depended on the patronage of a soldier. A powerful centurion claimed her after her previous protector fell in battle. "You belong to me now," he stated simply.
The barbarian horde swept through her village, and their chieftain claimed her as his prize. He threw her over his horse and said, "You will warm my furs and give me strong sons."
She was a shield-maiden, defeated and disarmed on the battlefield. The warrior standing over her chose not to kill her. "I'll take you as a thrall instead," he decided, tying her hands. "You'll serve me better alive."
The invasion was over, and she was identified as the leader of the failed resistance. The new governor summoned her. "Your rebellion is crushed," he said. "Your punishment will be to serve me, personally and publicly."
A dragon burned her city to ash and then, in human form, picked her from the survivors. "You will be my treasure," the handsome, terrifying man said. "The jewel of my new hoard."
The peace accord required an exchange of noble children to be raised in enemy courts. The enemy king took a special interest in his new ward. "You are a symbol of peace," he'd say. "You must be very... accommodating."
The assault on the castle was successful, and he was the first knight over the wall, a deed which granted him his pick of the plunder. He strode past gold and jewels and stopped in front of the lord's terrified daughter. "Her," he said.
She was a medic on the losing side, captured and brought to the enemy MASH tent. The chief surgeon looked her over. "We're short on nurses," he said. "And I have a personal need for an assistant. You'll do."
The raiding party took her from her coastal village back to their icy homeland. The Jarl who led the raid presented her to his men. "I brought a fine new servant for my hall," he boomed. "But she serves me first."
As the last survivor of the royal family, her marriage to the usurper would legitimize his throne. "You will be my queen," he said, forcing his ring onto her finger. "And you will perform your duties, starting now."
The city was under a brutal siege, and her father, the governor, sent her to the enemy camp to negotiate terms. The enemy general laughed. "The only terms I accept are your unconditional surrender," he said, "and you, as the down payment."
He was a foreign mercenary captain hired to defend the city, but the pay was late. He stormed into the council chambers and grabbed the chief magistrate's daughter. "No pay, no protection," he snarled. "Instead, I'll take my payment now."
The law of the fleet stated that any woman found stowing away on a warship became the "property of the crew." The captain, however, had other ideas. "The captain always gets first choice," he announced, dragging her to his cabin.
She was a temple priestess in a city taken by a conquering army that worshipped a different god. The enemy high priest had her brought to his desecrated altar. "Your false god is dead," he said. "Now you will serve a real one."
After her husband was killed in a duel, she was, by tradition, inherited by his brother. "You are family property now," her brother-in-law said. "And I am the head of the family."
The occupation was brutal, and a curfew was in effect. She was caught outside after hours by a patrol of soldiers. The sergeant grinned. "Look what we have here," he said to his men. "Someone wants to play after dark."
She was a political dissident, arrested and thrown into a military black site. The commander in charge of the facility reviewed her file. "You have no rights here," he said. "You don't even officially exist. You belong to me."
The alien fleet conquered Earth in a day. The alien viceroy chose her, a top scientist, to be his "cultural liaison." "You will teach me the ways of your people," he commanded. "Starting with your most intimate customs."
She tried to assassinate the invading warlord, but failed. He caught her himself, disarming her with ease. "I admire your fire," he said, pressing her against the wall. "I will enjoy taming it."
The kingdom's greatest knight was promised any reward if he could slay the monster. He succeeded, and when the king asked his desire, the knight looked at the king's beautiful, defiant daughter and said, "I want her."
The castle was running out of food, and the only way to save her people was to surrender herself to the besieging commander. She rode out to his tent, where he told her, "A wise sacrifice. I accept your terms."
She was a noblewoman from a rival faction, captured in a skirmish. The prince who caught her decided against a ransom. "You're more valuable to me here," he said, "as my personal guest."
During the sacking of the city, she hid, but was found by an enemy officer. "A pretty little mouse hiding from the cats," he chuckled. "Don't worry. I won't share my toys."
The war between the two space empires ended with her planet being ceded to the enemy. The new Imperial Governor summoned her, the planetary representative. "Your planet is a fine acquisition," he said. "I trust its women are as fertile as its fields."
He was a gladiator slave who led a successful rebellion, seizing the city. He stormed the villa of his former master and found the master's daughter. "Everything he owned is now mine," he said to her. "Including you."
As a tribute to the victorious dragon rider, she was chained to a rock at the base of his mountain lair. He landed before her, dismounted, and said, "A fitting offering."
The quartermaster of the invading army was in charge of distributing loot. He kept the most valuable 'items' for himself, including the captured women. He looked at her and said, "You'll be part of my private stock."
She was a sorceress whose magic failed to stop the invasion. The enemy battle-mage who broke her wards claimed her as his prize. "Your power is broken," he said. "Now you will learn to serve power."
The feudal system gave the lord ownership over the serfs on his land. When he came to inspect his new territory, acquired through war, he summoned her. "You have a new master now," he informed her.
The pirate king captured the merchant ship she was traveling on. He had her brought to his cabin. "Welcome aboard the Sea Serpent," he said with a wolfish grin. "You're the new ship's figurehead."
She was the best sharpshooter in the militia, but she was captured. The enemy commander took her rifle and then her. "Such a deadly weapon," he said. "Let's see if the woman who wields it is just as impressive."
The revolution failed, and its leaders were being rounded up. The secret police chief found her, a key strategist, in her hideout. "Your war is over," he said. "Your debriefing, however, is just beginning."
The terms of surrender required the defeated army to hand over all its "assets." The victorious general looked at the captured female intelligence officer and said, "She counts as an asset."
A vampire army swept across the land, and she was captured to be used as a blood slave. The vampire prince, however, decided she was too beautiful to be used by his common soldiers. "You will serve me, and me alone," he decreed.
She was a diplomat sent to negotiate with a brutal space commodore. He listened to her proposal, then laughed. "I will have your planet," he said, "and I will have you. In that order."
Her city was saved from destruction by a company of mercenaries. Their captain came to claim his payment, which was stipulated in the contract as "the finest treasure in the city." He looked at her, the mayor's daughter, and said, "That would be you."
The ancient magical pact stated that if the city's walls ever fell, the queen would become the property of the conqueror. When the gates shattered, she knew her fate was sealed.
He was a Viking chieftain who had just won a vast tract of land in a war. "A new farm needs a farmer's wife," he said, grabbing her from the crowd of terrified villagers. "You'll do."
The rebellion was crushed, and she, a fiery revolutionary, was captured by the Imperial Governor she sought to overthrow. "It seems you'll be staying in the palace after all," he said calmly. "Just not in the way you intended."
"By the sacred right of conquest," the priest-king proclaimed from the steps of the conquered temple, "I claim this land, its people, and its holiest priestess as my own. Bring her to me."
"The nanites in your bloodstream require a specific enzyme to remain inert," the scientist explained calmly, holding up a syringe. "An enzyme I produce. Comply, and you get your dose. Resist... and they will dissolve you from the inside out."
The back-alley doctor who installed her black-market cybernetic arm held the remote. "I included a few custom features," he said, and with a click, her own hand seized her arm. "For example, a manual override."
"This 'neural harmonizer' is supposed to cure your anxiety," the corporate therapist said, placing the device on her temple. "But it's also very good at inducing a state of... blissful compliance. Let's begin your treatment."
She woke up in a gleaming white room, strapped to a medical table, an IV in her arm. A man in a lab coat checked a monitor. "Subject is conscious. Begin Phase One: Involuntary Stimulus Response."
"The collar sends a debilitating shock if you disobey or try to leave the premises," her captor explained, holding the remote. "It also has a 'pleasure' setting. I suggest you learn to prefer the latter."
He controlled the supply of the addictive drug she needed to survive the planet's toxic atmosphere. "Time for your dose," he said, holding the injector. "But first, you have to earn it."
The asylum's director ordered her brought to the electroshock therapy room. "Your hysteria is becoming a problem," he said. "We're going to 'reset' your brain until you are calm and obedient."
"The bio-monitor tattoo on your wrist tells me everything," the warden of the private prison said. "Heart rate, fear levels, arousal. I'll know exactly what you're feeling as I make you my own."
He had replaced her memories with a new set, where she was his loving and devoted wife. "You seem confused, darling," he said with feigned concern. "It's our anniversary. Come, let's celebrate."
The alien symbiote bonded to her required regular doses of adrenaline and endorphins to survive. Her keeper, the only one who knew how to manage it, looked at her and said, "The symbiote is hungry. It's time to feed it."
"This 'gas of compliance' makes you very open to suggestion," the interrogator said as a sweet-smelling vapor filled the room. "So when I suggest you tell me everything, and then show me your gratitude, you will find it a wonderful idea."
The only way to control her dangerous, latent psychic powers was a special inhibitor drug. The government agent in charge of her case held the vial. "Be a good girl, and you get your medicine," he said. "Be bad... and we let you lose your mind."
Her new prosthetic legs were state-of-the-art, but they were also wirelessly controlled by their manufacturer. The company's CEO summoned her. "A demonstration of our product's full capabilities is in order," he said, holding up a tablet.
"You've been selected for our advanced 're-education' program," the orderly said, strapping her down. "We use a combination of psychotropic drugs and hypnotic suggestion to create the perfect, compliant citizen."
He had her trapped in a full-immersion virtual reality, where he was the system administrator. "In this world, I am a god," his voice boomed. "And you will worship me."
The life support system in her isolation suit was failing, and only he had the master controls. "Oxygen is a privilege, not a right," his voice crackled over the comms. "A privilege you will earn on your knees."
"The pheromones now being released into the room are designed to bypass your cognitive resistance," the scientist said from behind a glass screen. "You will soon find me irresistible."
The stasis pod she'd been in for a century opened, and a man stood over her. "Welcome to the future," he said. "Your body is atrophied. You are completely dependent on me for your rehabilitation. Let the therapy begin."
He had cloned her, and now he held the life of her perfect duplicate hostage. "Do as I say," he said, holding a syringe to the clone's neck, "or I will erase your 'sister' from existence."
"This device doesn't control your mind," he explained, attaching a node to her spine. "Just your central nervous system. You'll be fully aware of what's happening, but unable to stop your body from obeying me."
The antidote to the slow-acting poison he'd given her was administered in small, daily doses. "Miss a dose, and you die," he said. "The price of today's dose is your unconditional submission."
The advanced medical scanner revealed her deepest, most hidden phobia. "You're terrified of spiders, I see," her captor said, holding a small cage. "You can face your fear... or you can do whatever I ask."
The android tasked with being her companion and protector had a secret, more aggressive subroutine. He activated it remotely, and the android's eyes turned red. "New directive," it said, turning on her. "Subjugate and pacify."
"The chip in your brain gives you perfect memory and instant knowledge," the inventor said. "It also has a hidden backdoor. It allows me to give you commands you are physically incapable of disobeying."
Her bionic eyes could be disabled with the flick of a switch, plunging her into total darkness. "Do you want to see?" he asked, his hand on the switch. "Then be good for me."
The "gene-therapy" he'd given her was actually a biological time bomb, and only he had the counter-agent. "Your body will start to break down in one hour," he said. "Unless you give me a reason to save you."
The bio-tech collar around her neck monitored her vital signs and would sedate her if she became too agitated. "Struggle, and you sleep," he said. "Cooperate, and you might even enjoy yourself."
He was a 'dream-weaver', a technician who could enter and manipulate her subconscious while she slept. "No one can hear you scream inside your own mind," his voice whispered in her dream.
The nanite swarm he'd inhaled could be commanded to form solid, razor-sharp blades beneath his skin. He held his hand near her face. "These machines in my blood respond to my will," he said. "Don't give me a reason to will them to hurt you."
The behavior modification software installed in the colony's central computer could rewrite personalities. He, the system admin, brought up her file. "Let's edit your 'inhibitions' down to zero," he murmured.
The food paste dispensed by the bunker's system was laced with a powerful aphrodisiac that only he had the antidote for. "Eat up," he said with a smirk. "Or spend the rest of the day in a state of agonizing, unfulfilled need."
"This sonic device is tuned to a frequency that incapacitates you with vertigo," he said, holding the small disc. "But I'll turn it off... if you get on the bed."
The regeneration tank could heal any wound, but the process was agonizing without the proper neural dampener. He held the injector. "Do you want the painkiller?" he asked. "Or not?"
The personality matrix of the ship's AI was based on its captain. When the captain became unstable, so did the ship. "The Captain desires your presence in his quarters," the ship's calm, computerized voice announced as her cabin door locked.
The illegal 'empathy' implant allowed him to feel exactly what she was feeling. "I'll know if you're faking it," he whispered. "So you'd better make it good, for both our sakes."
Her cybernetic heart could be stopped with a remote signal. Her corporate owner looked at her from his desk. "Your employment contract is very clear about the company's ownership of its assets," he said. "And you are a company asset."
He had a device that could 'de-age' her, but the process was addictive and temporary. "Feeling old?" he asked as the wrinkles started to return. "Time for another treatment. You know the price."
The automated medical suite in her apartment was programmed to obey him, its creator. "Computer," he said, "administer sedative and remove patient's clothing. Prepare for a full physical examination."
The 'pacification field' installed in the prison block suppressed all aggressive thought, leaving only apathy. The guard walked in and said, "It's so much easier when you don't fight back."
He had altered her genetic code to recognize him as her 'alpha mate'. She hated him, but her own body betrayed her, responding to his scent and voice with primal submission. "See?" he said. "You were made for me."
The holographic 'ghost' he projected into her apartment could walk through walls but was programmed to feel solid to her. "You can't lock me out," the handsome, spectral figure said, stepping through her bedroom door. "And you can't escape."
"This drug temporarily paralyzes your voluntary muscles," he explained, as she found she couldn't move. "You're still fully conscious and can feel everything. Let's begin."
The gravity plating in her cell could be increased tenfold with the flick of a switch. "Kneel," the warden commanded from the observation deck. "Or I will make the very air crush you."
The teleportation device was faulty, and she was now stuck in a state of quantum entanglement with him. "We are linked," he said. "If I feel pleasure, you feel it too. And I intend to feel a great deal of pleasure."
The device clamped to her head recorded her thoughts and projected them onto a screen for him to read. "Your defiance is amusing," he said, reading the screen, "but ultimately futile. Your body will follow my commands soon enough."
Her android body needed a weekly 'software update' from the main corporate server to function. The technician in charge of her update smiled. "There's a 'glitch' in the system," he said. "We'll have to perform a manual, physical diagnostic."
The neural interface he'd invented allowed two people to share a single consciousness. He forced the connection, flooding her mind with his own thoughts and desires until they drowned out hers.
"The 'obedience chip' is a relic of the old war, but it works perfectly," the scavenger said, showing her the scar behind her ear she hadn't known was there. "Now, stand up and walk to the bed."
The terraforming colony's environmental suits were controlled by a central AI that he had hacked. "I can vent your oxygen at any time," his voice came over her comm. "Or I can make your suit's internal temperature very, very comfortable. Your choice."
"This injection doesn't harm you," the geneticist said, "it simply rewrites a small part of your DNA. The part that allows you to say 'no' to me."
Her father caught her sneaking back in after curfew, his disappointment quickly turning into something colder. "A daughter's disobedience requires a father's correction," he said, locking the front door. "We'll handle this here and now, where your mother can't hear."
Her older brother found her diary, reading her most private entries aloud with a cruel smirk. "You've been having some very naughty thoughts, little sister," he said, tossing the book aside. "Why don't we make them a reality?"
After her mother passed away, her grief was all-consuming, and her stepfather's comfort became cloying and possessive. He cornered her in the kitchen one night, whispering, "We're all the family we have left. We need to be close, in every way."
She was staying with her uncle for the summer, but his "fun uncle" persona vanished when he found her talking to a boy on the phone. "I'm responsible for you," he said, his hand clamping down on her shoulder. "I need to teach you what happens when you disrespect my rules."
Trapped in a remote cabin during a blizzard with her handsome cousin, the mood shifted from playful to predatory. "No one's coming for days," he said, blocking the only door. "It's not really wrong. We're just keeping each other warm."
"You look so much like your mother at this age," her father murmured, his hand stroking her hair as she sat beside him. "She was always so eager to please me. I expect the same from you."
"If you ever want to see your little sister again," her older brother threatened, his voice deadly serious after he'd locked the younger girl in her room, "you will come in here and do exactly as I say without a sound."
"I'm your father, and you will show me the respect I deserve," he said, locking her bedroom door behind him. "All of it."
"He'll never love you like I do," her older brother whispered, cornering her after her date dropped her off. "Let me show you what real love feels like."
Her stepfather cornered her in the laundry room, his voice dangerously low. "We wouldn't want to upset your mother, would we? This will be our little secret."
"We're family. It's not wrong if it's about love," her cousin insisted, pushing her back onto the bed at the family lake house. "Don't fight it."
Her uncle, her new legal guardian, closed the heavy study door. "The court gave me authority over your 'person'," he said. "It's time I took my duties seriously."
"You look so much like your mother tonight," her father murmured, his hand lingering on her waist after the party guests had left. "Just as beautiful, just as obedient."
Her twin brother looked at her with an unnerving intensity. "We're two halves of the same whole," he said, his hands trapping her against the wall. "It's only natural we become one."
"You owe me for taking you in," her brother-in-law growled, cornering her in the kitchen while her sister was out. "It's time you started paying your keep."
After their parents' funeral, her older brother held her, his comfort turning possessive. "It's just us now," he whispered. "We have to take care of each other, in every way."
"Stop crying," her father commanded, his hand gripping her shoulder. "A good daughter comforts her father in his time of need. Now, comfort me."
"This family has traditions you don't understand yet," her much older stepbrother said, leading her into the mansion's forbidden wing. "Your initiation starts now."
"Don't you want to make your daddy happy?" he asked in a childlike voice that chilled her to the bone. "Be a good girl for me."
"So innocent," her uncle chuckled, trapping her in the barn during a family reunion. "Don't worry, Uncle will teach you everything you need to know."
Her older brother found her crying in her room after a breakup. "He never deserved you," he said, stroking her hair, his touch lingering too long. "Let me show you how a man is supposed to treat you."
Her stepfather cornered her in the laundry room, blocking the only exit. "Your mother is asleep, and she doesn't need to know about this," he said, his voice dangerously low. "It's time you started contributing to this family."
She woke up to find her twin brother watching her from the edge of her bed. "We're two halves of the same soul, you know," he whispered, his hand reaching for her blanket. "There shouldn't be any boundaries between us."
Her uncle, her legal guardian since her parents passed, called her into his study. "Your inheritance is under my control," he reminded her. "And if you want to see any of it, you'll learn to be much more... appreciative."
"You look so much like your mother tonight," her father murmured, his breath smelling of whiskey as he backed her against a wall. "So beautiful. Let me pretend, just for a little while."
"I know you've been sneaking out with that boy," her older stepbrother sneered, holding up her phone with the messages displayed. "I won't tell Mom... if you give me what he's been getting."
At the remote family cabin, her handsome cousin waited until they were alone by the lake. "Come on, we're family," he coaxed, pulling her close. "It's not like it's really wrong. It's just a bit of fun."
"You failed your exam. You've disgraced me," her father said, his voice cold as ice. "You will be punished in my study, and you will learn the meaning of obedience."
Her brother barged in while she was changing, locking the door behind him. "I'm tired of hearing you with your boyfriend through these thin walls," he growled. "Tonight, you're going to be with a real man."
After her mother's funeral, her stepfather held her in a comforting hug that became something else entirely. "We're all each other has left now," he whispered into her hair. "We have to take care of each other."
Her grandfather, the frail family patriarch, summoned her to his bedside. "The family line is weak," he rasped, his hand surprisingly strong on her wrist. "It is your duty to ensure it continues, starting with me."
He watched her from across the bar, waiting for the drug he'd slipped into her drink to take full effect. When she slumped over, he smoothly caught her, telling the bartender, "She's my girlfriend, just a little too much tonight. I'll get her home."
She passed out on the couch at the frat party, the cheap punch finally overwhelming her. A guy who'd been watching her all night gently shook her shoulder, and when she didn't stir, he lifted her into his arms and carried her upstairs.
She was his best friend, and she was crying and drunk after a bad breakup. He helped her into her apartment and laid her on her bed, but instead of leaving, he sat down and whispered, "You won't even remember this in the morning."
The night nurse made her rounds, seeing the patient was fast asleep from the powerful pain medication. He quietly locked the hospital room door from the inside, knowing she wouldn't wake for hours.
He found her unconscious, thrown from her car after the accident on the deserted country road. After checking that she was breathing, he dragged her from the wreckage and into the woods, his mind set on something other than first aid.
The date had gone well, but she felt strangely dizzy after the last glass of wine he'd poured her. She woke up hours later in his bed, her clothes gone, with no memory of how she got there.
She fell asleep on the late-night train, her head against the window. The only other man in the carriage watched her for several stops, then gently shook her; when she only moaned and didn't wake, he carefully moved her head onto his lap.
The chloroform rag worked faster than he expected, and she went limp in his arms in the parking garage. He carried her to his van, laid her in the back, and thought about how much easier this was than having to listen to her scream.
Her roommate came home drunk and passed out on the living room floor. He stood over her for a long moment before deciding the opportunity was too perfect to pass up, lifting her onto the couch.
The dentist watched as the nitrous oxide took hold, her body relaxing completely under the sedation for her wisdom tooth extraction. "Just relax now," he murmured, more to himself than to her, as he locked the door.
He was her stalker, and he finally broke into her apartment, finding her fast asleep in her bed. He stood over her for a long time, savoring the moment before he finally got to touch his prize.
At the music festival, she'd taken a pill from a stranger and was now lost in a kaleidoscopic haze, barely aware of her surroundings. A man led her by the hand away from the crowds and into a dark, secluded tent.
Her drink at the corporate mixer was definitely stronger than she thought. She stumbled into an empty office to clear her head, and a moment later, a senior partner followed her in, closing the door behind him. "Feeling a little overwhelmed, are we?" he asked her slumped form.
The powerful sleeping pill her doctor prescribed worked too well. Her husband's friend, who was staying the night, found her utterly unresponsive in bed and saw his chance to have the woman he'd always coveted.
He was a paramedic at a chaotic accident scene, and the young woman he was treating was unconscious from a head injury. In the back of the ambulance, he told his partner he needed to "check for internal bleeding," pulling the privacy curtain closed.
"This will just help you relax," the massage therapist said, offering her a special herbal tea before the session. She drank it, and the world melted away into a warm, sleepy fog, leaving her limp and compliant on his table.
She'd had far too many shots at her bachelorette party and was being "helped" to her hotel room by the male stripper from the club. "I'll make sure she gets to bed safely," he assured her friends, before closing the hotel room door.
The lone hiker found her unconscious near a steep cliff, a nasty gash on her forehead. Instead of calling for help, he carried her back to his isolated cabin, his mind racing with the possibilities.
He'd been drugging her food with small amounts of a sedative for weeks, making her feel constantly tired. Tonight, he doubled the dose, and when she fell asleep at the dinner table, he carried her to the bedroom.
The yoga instructor offered her a special water infused with "calming herbs" after a difficult session. She felt her limbs grow heavy and her mind drift, leaving her unable to protest as he began his "private lesson."
After the home invasion, the thieves tied her up and were about to leave, but one of them looked at her unconscious form. "Waste not, want not," he said to the others, unbuckling his belt.
The bartender saw the girl passed out in a booth, her friends having already left. He threw a towel over his shoulder and went over, saying "Closing time," before scooping her up and carrying her to the back office.
She was a journalist who had passed out from exhaustion while investigating a cold case in the newspaper archives. The old, creepy archivist found her slumped over a table and quietly wheeled her on a cart into his private back room.
During the long, overnight flight, she took a sleeping pill and was completely oblivious to the world. The man sitting next to her waited until the cabin lights were dimmed, then carefully lifted the blanket covering her.
He found her passed out drunk on a park bench in the middle of the night. He looked around, saw no one, and thought, "It's not safe for a girl to be out here alone. I'll take her somewhere... private."
The knockout gas filled the bank, and all the hostages and employees collapsed. One of the robbers walked over to the unconscious female bank teller he'd been eyeing earlier and said, "A little bonus for a job well done."
She'd been in a coma for weeks. A new, handsome orderly was assigned to her room, and he found himself fascinated by her still, beautiful form, eventually giving in to his dark impulses during a late-night shift.
At the cast party for the play, the lead actor made her a "special" drink to celebrate their success. She woke up hours later in his dressing room, her costume in a heap on the floor.
He was a firefighter who pulled an unconscious woman from a burning building. In the chaos, he carried her not to the paramedics, but to a secluded alley nearby, succumbing to a sudden, dark urge.
The tranquilizer dart was silent, and she collapsed in the middle of her own backyard. Her kidnapper stepped out from the trees, checked her pulse, and then easily lifted her over his shoulder.
At the sleep study clinic, she was wired up and fast asleep. A rogue technician disabled the cameras in her room and used the opportunity to conduct his own, unsanctioned "research."
She fainted from heat stroke at the crowded summer market. A man claiming to be a doctor offered to help, carrying her into a cool, dark storefront that he quickly locked from the inside.
The powerful opiate administered after her surgery left her in a hazy, dreamlike state, unable to move or speak clearly. She was vaguely aware of her surgeon returning to her recovery room long after the procedure was over.
"It's a new kind of truth serum," the spy said to his captive, injecting her with the drug. It worked, but it also left her completely paralyzed and unable to resist as he decided to "interrogate" her more thoroughly.
The cult initiation involved drinking a powerful hallucinogen that left the initiates incapacitated and open to suggestion. The cult leader would then choose one of the new members to personally "welcome" into the fold.
He was her personal trainer, and he gave her a "recovery drink" after a grueling workout. She felt the world spin and her muscles turn to jelly, collapsing onto the gym mat at his feet. "Perfect," he said.
She passed out at her desk from exhaustion after working a 72-hour shift. The night security guard, who had a crush on her, found her and decided it was his only chance to be close to her.
The sorcerer's sleeping spell was absolute, plunging the entire castle into a deep slumber. He walked past the sleeping guards and courtiers, straight to the princess's chambers, to claim the prize he'd come for.
She was a test subject for a new virtual reality system and was completely sedated for full immersion. The lead programmer entered the chamber and initiated a haptic subroutine that the subject would feel, but her mind would never register.
He found her phone and wallet next to her passed-out form on the beach. He found her address on her ID, and instead of calling for help, he decided to "help" her get home himself.
Her boyfriend dared her to chug the entire bottle of tequila, and she did, passing out almost immediately. His friends cheered, and the boyfriend said, "Alright guys, who's first?"
The alien abduction was swift, a beam of light and then nothing. she woke up naked and strapped to a table, a non-human creature observing her before it began its dispassionate, physical examination.
Her AA sponsor found her after she'd relapsed, passed out on her kitchen floor with an empty bottle next to her. "This is what happens when you stray from the path," he tutted, before lifting her onto the sofa.
The sleeping gas was piped through the ventilation system of the sorority house. The masked intruders moved from room to room, taking what they wanted from the helpless, unconscious young women.
He was a mortician, and the beautiful young woman on his table was the victim of a recent accident. As he began the embalming process alone in the mortuary, he was overcome by a dark temptation.
She fell from her horse while riding alone and was knocked unconscious. A rival landowner who coveted her and her property found her, and decided to stage a very different kind of "accident."
The potion was supposed to let her speak with the dead, but it simply rendered her unconscious. The charlatan who sold it to her checked her pulse and said, "Well, at least the night isn't a total loss."
In the cryo-stasis facility, a system malfunction caused a single pod to open, but the occupant remained in a deep, unconscious sleep. A lone technician on duty discovered the error and his opportunity.
She'd been hypnotized at a stage show, and the hypnotist gave her a post-hypnotic suggestion to "fall into a deep sleep" when she heard a trigger word. He followed her after the show, uttered the word, and caught her as she collapsed.
He was her estranged husband, and he broke into the house, using a key he'd kept. He found her asleep in their old bed, and decided to reclaim the marital rights he still felt entitled to.
The heavy oak door of the panic room clicked shut, plunging them into silence and dim emergency light. "My father built this to keep people out," he said, turning to her with a dark smile. "But it works just as well to keep people in."
She woke from the car crash with her leg pinned beneath the dashboard, the smell of gasoline in the air. The other driver, miraculously unharmed, crawled into the wreckage with her. "Looks like you're not going anywhere," he said. "And neither am I."
The cave-in had trapped them deep underground, with only one working headlamp—his. "If you want the light," he said, his voice echoing in the oppressive darkness, "you'll stay very close to me."
She was paralyzed from the waist down after the accident, and he was her new, handsome physical therapist. "You'll have to trust me completely to get you moving again," he said, his hands moving from her legs to her hips. "Let's start by testing your response to stimuli."
The boat capsized in the storm, and she awoke on a deserted beach, saved by the island's only inhabitant. "You're weak. You need my help to survive," the grizzled stranger grunted, dragging her towards his crude hut. "You'll earn your keep."
She was locked in the airtight bank vault with the manager during a robbery, the timed lock set for 12 hours. "No one can hear us. No one is coming," he said, loosening his tie. "We have a lot of time to kill."
A sudden, inexplicable blindness had struck her, leaving her completely dependent on the orderly in the hospital. "Don't worry, I'll be your eyes," he whispered, leading her down the wrong corridor. "I'll guide you every step of the way."
The elevator was stuck, and the emergency phone was dead. The powerfully built maintenance man pried open the doors, only to reveal a solid concrete wall. "Looks like we're going to be here a while," he said, turning back to her.
A magical curse had rendered her mute, unable to scream or call for help. The sorcerer who cast it backed her into a corner. "It's so much better when you can't say no," he mused.
She was strapped into the malfunctioning carnival ride, suspended high above the ground. The ride operator, the only one who could get her down, climbed the structure to 'help'. "Quite a predicament you're in," he said, his face level with hers.
The snowstorm had made the mountain pass impassable, trapping her in an isolated cabin with a stranger she'd just met. "No one is getting through this for days," he said, stoking the fire and barring the door. "We'll have to keep each other warm."
A rare disease had weakened her bones to the point of extreme fragility. "Be careful," her caretaker warned, his grip on her uncomfortably tight. "One wrong move could shatter you. It's best if you just don't move at all."
She was a ballerina whose ankle was badly broken, her career over. The wealthy patron who had always admired her offered to pay for her care. "You are so fragile now," he said, running a hand up her cast. "You need someone strong to look after you."
Amnesia had erased her past, leaving her with only the 'husband' who'd found her. "You're my wife, you just don't remember," he said patiently, leading her to the bedroom. "Don't worry, I'll help you remember what you like."
She was bound and gagged, a helpless captive in his soundproofed basement. "Scream all you want," he said, beginning to unbuckle his belt. "It's just for you and me to hear."
The submarine had lost power and sunk to the bottom of the trench, with only her and the captain in the control room. "Life support will last for 24 hours," he said calmly. "We might as well enjoy our last day."
A magical spell had shrunk her to the size of a doll, and he found her in his study. "Well, what have we here?" he mused, picking her up between his thumb and forefinger. "A new little plaything."
She was handcuffed to the bed, a punishment from her powerful and controlling husband. "You will stay there until you've learned your lesson," he said, leaving the room, only for his brutish head of security to enter moments later. "The master is out," the guard said. "But your lesson isn't over."
She was tied to the train tracks as the rumble of the approaching locomotive grew louder. The villain who put her there knelt beside her. "There is one way I could be persuaded to save you," he said. "Beg for it."
After being pulled from a frozen lake, she was suffering from severe hypothermia, unable to stop shaking. "We need to get your body temperature up, fast," the rescuer said, stripping off his own clothes. "Skin-to-skin contact is the only way."
She was trapped under a fallen bookshelf in the library after an earthquake, her legs crushed. The only other survivor, a man she'd always feared, approached her. "Looks like you need my help," he said, his shadow falling over her.
A selective paralysis agent affected only her limbs, leaving her a living statue. "You're so beautiful when you're still," her captor whispered, tracing the line of her jaw. "So perfectly obedient."
The heavy door of the walk-in freezer had locked behind her and the restaurant manager. "It won't be opened until morning," he said, his breath fogging. "We'll freeze to death... unless we generate our own heat."
She was a ghost, unable to interact with the physical world, bound to her old house. The new owner, a man who could somehow see her, smiled. "You're trapped here with me," he said. "And there's nothing you can do about it."
She was a test pilot in a new g-force simulator that had malfunctioned, pinning her to the seat. The supervising technician walked into the centrifuge. "The system is locked," he said. "But the observation camera is still working."
Her hands were bound in unbreakable magic-dampening shackles. "Your power is gone," the enemy knight said, pushing her back onto the bed. "Now you're just a woman."
She was chained to the wall in a dungeon, a political prisoner of a rival kingdom. The prince came to visit her, alone. "My father wants you to break," he said. "I'm here to see that it happens."
After a magical attack, her voice was stolen, leaving her unable to cast spells or cry for help. The wizard who took it cornered her. "Silence is golden," he hissed.
She was stuck in quicksand, sinking deeper with every movement. He stood on the bank, watching her struggle. "I could pull you out," he offered. "But you'll have to promise me a reward."
The experimental anti-gravity chamber malfunctioned, leaving her floating helplessly in the middle of the room. He was the only one with a magnetic tether. "Having trouble getting down?" he asked with a smirk.
She was bound to a ceremonial altar as a sacrifice to a dark god. But it wasn't a god who appeared—it was the high priest. "The god requires a vessel," he said. "And I am his humble servant."
The fall left her with a severe concussion, making the world spin and her thoughts muddy. He found her stumbling in the alley. "You're hurt," he said, his voice sounding trustworthy as he led her into a dark apartment. "Let me take care of you."
She was trapped in a spider's web of immense size, woven by a magical creature. The creature's master, a dark elf, approached her. "My pet has brought me a beautiful fly," he said. "Struggle all you want. It will only trap you further."
Her space suit was punctured during a spacewalk, and she was running out of air. He was on the other side of the airlock door. "I'll let you in," he said over the comms. "If you promise to be very, very grateful."
She was tied to a chair in a room slowly filling with water. Her captor watched from a dry platform above. "You can have the key to your restraints," he said, dangling it. "But first, you have to please me."
A witch's curse had turned her into a swan, only able to regain her human form at midnight, and only for an hour. A man discovered her secret and stole her feathered cloak. "You'll be staying human tonight," he said. "With me."
She was a scientist who had accidentally teleported into the solid wall of her lab, her body fused with the concrete up to her waist. Her rival, the only one who knew the reversal codes, found her. "What an interesting position you're in," he said.
She was locked in the cargo hold of a pirate ship, and the captain came to inspect his new 'cargo'. "Welcome aboard," he grinned. "You're part of the treasure now."
She was a mermaid, caught in a fishing net and hauled onto the deck of a boat. The fisherman looked at his impossible catch. "I think I'll keep this one," he decided.
A magical sickness had sapped all her strength, leaving her bedridden and weak. The healer assigned to her care had a predatory look in his eyes. "You are completely at my mercy," he murmured, "for your own good, of course."
She was strapped into a straitjacket in a padded cell of a corrupt asylum. The head doctor came in. "Your therapy isn't working," he said. "We're going to try a more... hands-on approach."
She was clinging to a piece of driftwood in the middle of the ocean when his yacht appeared. He pulled her aboard. "You're very lucky I came along," the wealthy man said, handing her a robe. "Now, let's discuss the terms of your rescue."
A magical artifact had petrified her entire body, except for her eyes. She could only watch in silent horror as her captor moved her stone form into his bedroom, like a statue. "You're my perfect work of art," he said.
The fire had trapped her on the roof of the skyscraper, and the only other person there was a man she'd always detested. "It's a long way down," he said, cornering her against the ledge. "Looks like we're going out with a bang."
She was hypnotized, fully aware but unable to control her own limbs. "Your mind is awake, but your body is mine to command," the hypnotist's voice soothed. "And I command you to please me."
She was caught in a high-tech energy net that held her suspended and immobile in mid-air. The arms dealer who owned it smiled. "A perfect demonstration of my product's effectiveness," he said to his client, gesturing to her helpless form.
She was a test subject for a new teleportation device, but the return pad was destroyed, stranding her in his private lab. "There's no way back for you," he said. "You live here now. With me."
She was put into a deep coma by her enemies, her mind trapped in a dream. But her rival had found a way to enter her dreamscape. "Even in sleep, you're not safe from me," his voice echoed in her dream.
She was bound with ropes made of living, sentient vines that tightened with every struggle. "They respond to fear," her captor, a druid, explained. "The more you fight, the tighter they'll hold you for me."
She was handcuffed to the steering wheel of a car that had been meticulously prepared to sink into a lake. "You have about five minutes," her captor said from the shore. "Unless you can convince me to come and let you out."
Her transformation locket was shattered by the dark general's final blow, the magical light flickering and dying. As her uniform dissolved into tatters, he stood over her. "The show is over, little hero," he said. "Now for the grand finale."
Her ultimate attack, the 'Starlight Purification', was absorbed into the demon lord's body, making him stronger. He laughed as she fell to her knees, completely drained of power. "Thank you for the meal," he purred, grabbing her by the hair. "Now for dessert."
The monster of the week wasn't a monster at all, but a handsome, charming man who easily dodged her attacks. He cornered her and whispered, "My power isn't chaos, little one. It's desire. And you've been fighting it all night."
The villain didn't fight her; he simply revealed his true identity as the popular boy she had a crush on at school. "I know your secret, Cure Sunshine," he said, holding up a picture of her family. "And now you're going to do exactly as I say."
She was caught mid-transformation, the ribbons of light tangling around her as the villain's anti-magic spell hit. She was left half in her uniform, half in her school clothes, and completely powerless. "Awkward," the villain mocked. "Let me help you get undressed."
Her talking animal mascot, her mentor and friend, was captured and held in a crackling energy cage. "Surrender yourself to me," the dark sorcerer commanded, "or your fluffy little friend gets dissected."
The villain's attack wasn't painful; it was a wave of pure, corrupting pleasure that short-circuited her powers and made her knees buckle. "Your light is based on purity," he hissed in her ear. "It has no defense against true ecstasy."
After a brutal battle, she lay defeated, her wand broken and her costume shredded. The victorious demon general knelt beside her. "You fought well," he said, his hand stroking her cheek. "Your reward is to become my personal spoil of war."
The villain trapped her team in crystals, leaving her alone and terrified. "It doesn't have to be this way for you," he offered, his voice deceptively gentle. "Join me. Be my queen. Your friends' freedom in exchange for your... loyalty."
Her powers were derived from the city's hope, but after the villain's fear campaign, her strength dwindled to nothing. He cornered her in an alley, her transformation failing. "The city doesn't believe in you anymore," he said. "But I do. I believe you'll be a perfect toy."
The magical contract she signed with the cute mascot had fine print she never read. As the mascot revealed its true, monstrous form, it said, "The price for your power was your body and soul, to be claimed by my master at his leisure. He is here now."
The villain's castle was a living entity that drained her powers the deeper she went. By the time she reached the throne room, she could barely stand. "Welcome, little light," the king said from his throne. "I've been expecting you. You're already mine, you just don't know it yet."
Her rival magical girl, consumed by jealousy, made a pact with the darkness. After defeating her, the rival stood over her, a cruel smirk on her face. "The dark lord wants a new plaything," she said. "And I'm giving him you as a gift."
The anti-magic chains locked around her wrists didn't just hold her; they actively siphoned her power, making her weaker by the second. "Feel that emptiness?" her captor asked. "Soon it will be filled with a new purpose. My purpose."
He didn't defeat her; he defeated her entire city. He stood on the balcony of the conquered city hall and gave his ultimatum to the terrified populace: "Bring me your hero, bound and willing, or I burn this city to the ground."
The source of her power, the Crystal of Hearts, was found and corrupted by the enemy. When she tried to transform, the light was black, and her uniform reformed into a dark, revealing parody of itself. "That's much better," the villain approved. "Now you look like you belong to me."
Her power was love, but the villain was an incubus who fed on it. The more she blasted him with her heart-beams, the stronger and more handsome he became, until he simply walked through her final attack and took her in his arms. "Delicious," he whispered.
The "monster" she was fighting was an illusion, a distraction until the real trap was sprung. An energy cage snapped shut around her, and the mastermind appeared. "The hero is caught," he announced. "Let the taming begin."
She was tricked into entering a "sacred temple" that was actually the villain's lair. The door vanished behind her. "This temple amplifies my power and nullifies yours," his voice echoed. "You are now just a girl, and I am a god."
The final battle took place in a dimension of pure darkness, where her light-based powers quickly faded to nothing. "You're out of your element, hero," the void-mage said, emerging from the shadows.
The villain created a perfect, handsome clone of her high school crush to seduce her and learn her weakness. Once he had what he needed, the clone revealed its true nature, pinning her down. "The data collection is over," it said coldly. "Now for practical application."
Her attack, 'Innocent Kiss', was meant to purify a monster, but the target was the dark lord in disguise. He caught the magical kiss in his hand, and it solidified into a glowing slave collar. "How fitting," he said, walking towards her. "You've forged your own chains."
The entire battle was a ruse to exhaust her. After she defeated the final giant monster, she collapsed, only for the dark general to step out from behind a pillar. "A fine performance," he said, scooping her limp form into his arms. "But that was just the opening act."
She was hit with a curse that made her unable to touch anyone without causing them immense pain... except for the one who cursed her. "It's lonely, isn't it?" he said, offering his hand. "But you can touch me all you want."
The magical girl academy was overrun by dark forces. The evil headmaster had her brought to his office. "Your training has been inadequate," he said. "I will be providing you with a new, more intensive, one-on-one curriculum."
Her power was tied to the moon, but the sorcerer cast a spell to blot out the moonlight for a week. As her strength vanished, he stepped into her room through her window. "No moon, no power," he said. "Just you and me."
The villain didn't want to fight her; he wanted to collect her. He trapped her in a magical crystal, a permanent, living trophy for his collection. "You are the centerpiece," he said, admiring his prize. "My very own captured angel."
She was de-aged by a magical attack, her mind and body reverting to that of a helpless child, though she retained her adult memories. "Now you're small enough not to be a threat," the villain cooed, picking her up.
He cast a spell that linked her life force to his. "Now, if you hurt me, you hurt yourself," he explained with a smirk. "So I suggest you do everything you can to make sure I remain... very, very pleased."
The "helpless civilian" she saved from a collapsing building was the villain in disguise. Once she had exhausted herself saving him, he dropped the act. "Thank you for the rescue, hero," he said, pinning her to the rubble. "Now let me thank you properly."
The villain injected her with a serum that made her crave dark energy. The only source for miles was him. "You feel the hunger, don't you?" he asked as she trembled. "Come and get your fix."
Her entire team was defeated and corrupted, now serving as the villain's loyal bodyguards. They were the ones who captured her and brought her before his throne. "Welcome to the family," he said.
The magical artifact she sought was a trap. When she touched it, her own powers were used to bind her in unbreakable chains of pure light. "How ironic," her nemesis said, stepping out of the shadows. "Harmed by the very thing you cherish."
He placed a 'Submission Crest' on her forehead. It didn't control her mind, but it did control her body. "Your mind is still your own," he explained. "I want to hear you say 'no', even as your body says 'yes'."
The magical forest she drew her power from was corrupted and turned into a nightmare landscape. The twisted trees themselves grabbed her, their branches holding her fast for their new master. "The forest serves me now," he said. "And so will you."
She was hit by a "truth spell" that made her unable to resist any direct command. The sorcerer looked at her and said simply, "Come here."
The villain broadcast her secret identity to the entire world, then sent his monsters after her family. He gave her a call. "Your choice," he said. "Surrender to me at my castle, or watch your loved ones pay for your secret."
Her 'Shield of Virtue' was shattered by his 'Blade of Sin'. The shards embedded in her skin, making her feel an alien warmth. "My sin is inside you now," he whispered. "A part of you forever."
The battle took place in a hall of mirrors, and the villain created dozens of copies of himself. She was quickly overwhelmed, grabbed from all sides. "So many hands to play with," his voice echoed around her.
He didn't attack her, but her shadow. With a dark spell, he animated her shadow, and it was the one that grabbed her, its cold, flat hands impossibly strong. "You can't escape your own darkness," he said.
The villain was a psychic who didn't break her body, but her mind. He trapped her in a perfect dream world where she had already fallen in love with him, and took advantage of her helpless, dreaming body in the real world.
Her magical uniform was a living symbiote. The villain used a sonic frequency to turn it against her, the suit tightening and restricting her movements until she was helpless. "Good suit," he commanded. "Now, hold her for me."
The villain was an 'anti-magical girl', with dark parodies of all her powers. After a long fight, his 'Despair Blast' overcame her 'Hope Beam', and she fell at his feet. "Darkness always beats the light," he said. "It's the natural order."
She was forced into a 'magical duel' where the loser becomes the winner's slave. She fought her hardest, but he was simply stronger. "By the ancient laws of magic, you are now mine," he declared as the glowing shackle formed on her wrist.
He kidnapped the goddess who granted her powers, and was now speaking through her. "Your goddess commands you to kneel," the goddess's voice said from his mouth, full of pain and shame.
Her power was to purify evil, but he wasn't evil, just completely and utterly selfish. Her attacks had no effect. "You can't purify apathy," he said with a shrug, easily sidestepping her attack and grabbing her.
The villain trapped her in a time loop of the moment of her defeat. After experiencing her failure a hundred times, her spirit broke, and on the 101st loop, she simply dropped her wand and knelt before he even attacked. "Finally," he said.
He cast a spell that swapped her body with that of a normal, powerless girl. He kept her, the magical girl now trapped in a weak, mundane body, for himself. "Now you're no threat to anyone," he said. "Just a prize."
Her power came from her beautiful singing voice. He used a curse to steal it, leaving her mute and powerless. He held her stolen voice in a glowing crystal and said, "If you ever want to sing again, you'll have to please me in other ways."
She finally defeated the Great Dark Lord, using up every last drop of her power. As he dissolved into dust, his second-in-command, a cunning general, stepped out from the shadows. "Thank you for getting him out of my way," he said to her, as she collapsed in exhaustion. "As a reward, I'll claim you as the first jewel of my new empire."
The human warlord who conquered her hidden city strode into the throne room, his iron boots echoing on the crystal floor. "Your people's magic is broken," he grunted, pulling the elven queen from her seat. "Now, I will break you."
The slaver's cold iron net fell over her in the forest, smothering her connection to the woods and her magic. "Look what we have here, boys," the leader sneered. "A real live wood elf. The collectors pay extra for purity, so let's check the merchandise."
The Orc chieftain stood over the stump of her sacred Heartwood tree, the source of her power, his axe still dripping sap. "Your tree is dead," he growled, turning on the weeping elven guardian. "Now you have nothing left to protect."
A human sorcerer had trapped her in a room where every stone was etched with magic-dampening runes. "Not so proud without your spells, are you?" he said, cornering the powerless elf maiden. "Now you're just a beautiful doll for my collection."
To save her forest from the human king's army, she was offered as a peace-bride. On their wedding night, the brutish king tore her silken robes. "I own your forest, your people, and now," he said, "I own you."
The dark elf assassin slipped into her chambers, a cruel smirk on his face. "You surface dwellers are so soft," he hissed, his blade at her throat. "Let me show you what true elven passion is like... the kind that takes what it wants."
She was the last of the Snow Elves, a living treasure, and the brutish northern Jarl had just captured her. "They said your kind was extinct," he boomed, throwing her onto a pile of furs. "I will make sure that is no longer true."
The dwarven miners broke through into her subterranean star-crystal cavern, their greed palpable. The foreman grabbed her, his calloused hands rough on her delicate skin. "Forget the gems," he yelled to his men. "We've found the real treasure!"
She was a ranger, caught in a hunter's trap while patrolling the woods. The human hunter knelt beside her, a leering grin on his face. "I've always wanted to mount a rare elf head on my wall," he said. "But I think I'll have some fun with the rest of you first."
A dragon, in its handsome human form, cornered her in the ruins of her city that he himself had burned. "Of all the treasures in your city," he purred, his eyes glowing with inner fire, "you are the most exquisite. I will add you to my hoard."
The pirate captain who seized her ship had never seen an elf before. He had her brought to his cabin, bound in ropes. "Well, well," he chuckled, "Look at the pointy-eared prize the sea gave me today. Let's see if the legends about elven women are true."
The Imperial Inquisitor accused her of practicing forbidden nature magic. "You will be purified of your heresy," he said calmly, as guards strapped the elven priestess to a cold metal table. "The purification will be thorough."
The goblin shaman had captured her to use in a ritual to steal her longevity. "Your long life will be mine," he cackled, as his goblin warriors held her down on the altar. "But first, we use you for other rituals."
A human lord, obsessed with elven beauty, bought her from slavers and placed her in a gilded cage in his chambers. "You are my perfect songbird," he said, unlocking the cage door. "Now, sing for your master."
Her own people, desperate to appease the encroaching human empire, betrayed her and handed her over. The Imperial Governor looked her over and said, "A wise gift. Your people will be spared, in exchange for your... lifelong diplomatic service to me."
The mercenary company was hired to clear out the "haunted" elven forest. The captain found her, the last guardian. "Looks like the ghost is real," he said to his men. "And she's beautiful. Pin her down."
A plague created by a human warlock had swept through the elven lands, weakening them. He walked through the sick and dying to her, the healer. "Your magic cannot stop my plague," he said. "And it cannot stop me."
The half-elf warlord held a deep-seated hatred for his pure-blooded kin. When he conquered her enclave, he had her brought to him. "You always looked down on me," he spat. "Now you will look up at me from your knees."
A powerful demon was summoned into her sacred grove, corrupting the land with its presence. It cornered the terrified elf. "This place of purity will be my new home," the demon boomed. "And you will be my welcoming party."
She was an elven scholar who had ventured into human lands, only to be arrested for espionage. The captain of the guard threw her into a cell. "We have ways of making elves talk," he said, locking the door behind him.
The centaur war-band leader charged into the elven glade, scattering her people. He snatched her up, the clan's matriarch, and said, "The forest belongs to the centaurs now. And you belong to me."
She was a Sea Elf, washed ashore after a storm and found by the inhabitants of a crude fishing village. The village leader looked at her otherworldly beauty and said, "The sea has given us a gift. A gift we will all share."
The human king was dying, and a prophecy said only the blood of a pure-born elf could save him. His knights captured her. "The king needs your 'essence'," the captain said, as he dragged her towards the king's bedchamber.
A group of adventurers broke into the ancient elven tomb she was guarding. The brutish warrior of the group cornered her. "We came for treasure," he said, "and we've found it."
She was a Sun Elf priestess, and her temple was overrun by shadow creatures and their master. "The sun has set on your little religion," the shadowmancer whispered, his form coalescing from the darkness. "Now, you will learn to worship the night."
The lumberjack had been warned to stay out of the elf's woods, but he didn't listen. He caught her trying to sabotage his work. "You pointy-eared freaks think you own everything," he snarled, pushing her against a felled tree. "Let me show you what a real man owns."
As a Moon Elf, her power was tied to the full moon. An astrologer-mage captured her and locked her in an observatory during a lunar eclipse, when she was at her weakest. "Perfect timing," he said. "The heavens are aligned for my experiment."
Her elven ship was wrecked on the shores of a savage, uncharted island. The tribal chieftain of the human natives found her. "Sky-woman," he grunted, pointing at her and then at his hut. "You. Come."
The arena master had acquired a rare prize: an elven warrior. "She's too beautiful to be wasted in the pits," he announced to a cheering crowd of nobles. "Instead, she will be the prize for tonight's champion."
A human duke had captured her and forced her into a marriage to give his bloodline elven longevity and beauty. "Smile, my dear," he said as he led her to the wedding bed. "You are about to improve my family for generations."
The troll chieftain had taken her captive from a raid. He dragged her back to his filth-ridden cave. "Pretty elf," he growled, "make trolls pretty babies."
She was an elven diplomat in a human court, but her immunity was revoked when her kingdom was accused of treachery. The guards seized her. "You're not a diplomat anymore," the prince said. "You're a prisoner of war."
An alchemist, seeking the secret to elven longevity, kidnapped her for his experiments. "The secret must be in your blood, your very essence," he murmured, strapping her to his table. "I will extract it, one way or another."
The ogre warlord wanted an elven 'trinket' for his throne room. His raiding party brought him her, bound and gagged. "Good," he grunted. "Chain her to the armrest. I want something pretty to look at."

The raiders who sacked her town didn't steal gold, they stole women. "We do not sow, we conquer," their leader roared. "And we breed. You will make a fine addition to our stock."

"You are my ward, and you will do as I say!" her guardian finally snapped after her latest escapade. He locked her in her room, but returned later that night. "Your defiance ends tonight," he said. "Your obedience begins."

She was a sorceress's apprentice with immense power but no discipline. After she ruined a delicate ritual, her master bound her with magic. "You are arrogant and reckless," she said. "You will be taught submission, starting with serving the stable boy you look down on."
The wealthy heiress was used to getting her way, but the pirate who'd kidnapped her for ransom wasn't impressed. "Your daddy's money can't help you here," he sneered, tearing her designer dress. "On my ship, you're just another piece of loot."
Her older brother was now the head of the family and tired of her wild ways. "You've shamed this family for the last time," he said, locking her in her room. "You will not leave until you are broken and obedient. I'll start the process myself."
The arrogant noblewoman was captured in a battle by a common, brutish soldier. "You high-born ladies think you're so much better than us," he growled, throwing her over his shoulder. "I'm going to enjoy showing you what a real man is like."
After being expelled from another boarding school, her father sent her to a strict, isolated disciplinary academy. The headmaster looked at her file and said, "We have special methods for defiant girls like you. Your re-education begins tonight."
"You can't tell me what to do!" she shrieked at her new stepfather as he backed her against the wall. "Your mother may have married me," he said, his voice dangerously calm, "but it is I who will be mastering you."
The handsome tutor her father hired finally had enough of her insolence. "You've refused every lesson I've tried to teach you," he said, locking the library door. "So now we will move on to a subject you will not be allowed to fail: anatomy."
She tried to fire the bodyguard her father assigned her, but he just laughed and pushed her back into the car. "Your father pays me to keep you safe, little princess," he said, locking the doors. "But he never specified what I had to keep you safe from. Tonight, it's not me."
After she intentionally crashed the new car her father bought her, he didn't yell. He simply led her to his study and said, "You clearly don't appreciate the things I give you. So I will give you something you will be forced to appreciate."
"My father owns this town! I'll have your badge!" she screamed at the sheriff who arrested her. He just smiled, unlocked her cell, and stepped inside. "In here, brat, I own you."
Her older brother caught her sneaking out again, easily overpowering her and throwing her back on her bed. "You think you're so grown up?" he sneered. "I'll treat you like a grown woman, then. The kind who learns to obey."
The rival CEO kidnapped her, and she was nothing but defiant. "My father will hunt you down!" she spat. "I know," he replied smoothly, tracing her jawline. "That's why my revenge has to be swift, personal, and something he can never, ever undo."
She was married off to a cold, powerful Duke to curb her wild behavior. On their wedding night, she refused him. "Your childish defiance ends now," he stated, effortlessly pinning her to the bed. "You are a Duchess, and you will perform your duties."
"You are a spoiled, worthless brat," her legal guardian and uncle said after she ruined another family dinner. "It's time you were made useful for something. Come here."
The stable boy she always delighted in tormenting finally snapped when she struck him with her riding crop. He grabbed it from her hand and cornered her in the hayloft. "You like to be in control, my lady?" he growled. "Let's see how you like it when you have none."
After being disinherited for her behavior, she went to her father's business partner for help. "Your father won't help you," he said, closing his office door. "But I will take you in. Under my complete authority, of course."
"I will not wear this dress!" she yelled, throwing the expensive gown at her new husband, a man she was forced to marry. He picked it up calmly, then turned to her. "You are right. You will wear nothing at all."
The pirate captain who'd captured her ship was amused by her fiery defiance. "I admire your spirit," he chuckled, signaling his men to leave them alone in his cabin. "It will make breaking it all the more satisfying."
Her stepbrother found her diary, filled with cruel words about him. "Such a nasty little mouth you have," he said, holding the open book. "I think it's time I taught it some new tricks."
The headmaster of the exclusive boarding school had her brought to his office after her latest prank. "Your father's donations can't protect you anymore," he said. "Your discipline will now be handled by me, personally."
"I hate you! I wish you were dead!" she screamed at her father during an argument. He stopped, his face like stone, and advanced on her. "You will learn to respect me," he said, his voice barely a whisper. "Even if I have to beat it into you."
The ski instructor she'd been mocking all day led her to a secluded 'expert' trail. "You think you're so much better than everyone?" he asked, pushing her against a tree. "Let's see how you handle a real challenge."

The leader of the rebellion captured her, the pampered daughter of the deposed dictator. "I'm going to make you pay for every luxury your family enjoyed," he hissed, tearing at her silk dress.

"You are nothing but a spoiled child playing at being a woman," her father's much younger, much crueler new wife told her. "I'm going to teach you what it means to be a real woman in this house. One who serves."
The band's lead singer, whom she'd arrogantly tried to seduce and dismiss backstage, wasn't letting her go. "You think you can play games with me, little girl?" he asked, pushing her against the amp. "The show's over, but our encore is just beginning."
Her older brother was sick of her entitled attitude and constant disrespect towards their mother. "Mom's gone for the weekend," he said, cornering her. "That leaves me in charge. And I have very different rules."
The man she'd been tormenting, her father's quiet chauffeur, finally had her alone on a long drive. He pulled the car over on a deserted road. "For months, you've treated me like dirt," he said, climbing into the back with her. "Now, you'll treat me like a king."
"I forbid you from seeing that boy!" her father yelled. When she defiantly screamed back, "You can't control me!", he snapped. "I can't?" he replied, his voice dropping dangerously. "We'll see about that."
The professor she tried to blackmail with false accusations turned the tables on her. He played a recording of her admitting the lie. "Your academic career is in my hands," he said. "And your immediate future is, too."

The corporate fixer hired by her father to clean up her latest scandal cornered her in her penthouse. "Your father wants me to teach you a lesson about consequences," he said. "Lesson one starts now."
"You are an embarrassment to this family's name," the clan patriarch told her, his voice cold as ice. "You will be disciplined until you are worthy of it. Take her to the punishment room."

Her older stepbrother, a battle-hardened soldier home on leave, was disgusted by her spoiled behavior. "In my world, insubordination is punished swiftly," he said, kicking her bedroom door shut. "Welcome to my world."
The powerful Fae lord she'd insulted was not forgiving. "Mortals with pretty faces think they can say what they please," he mused, his magic paralyzing her. "I will teach you the importance of a respectful tongue."
"You're a brat who needs to be put over someone's knee," her exasperated father always said. One night, after she pushed him too far, he grabbed her arm and said, "You know what? You're right. But I have a much better idea than just a spanking."
The detective she'd been giving the run-around to finally cornered her in an interrogation room, but didn't turn on the recorder. "You like playing games, don't you, rich girl?" he asked. "Let's play one of mine."
Her family sent her to a remote "behavioral reform" camp. The camp's director looked her over on the first day. "Here, you have no name," he said. "You are just a body, and I will teach it to obey."
"You're so young, so naive," her much older, powerful husband murmured on their arranged wedding night. "You have much to learn about your duties as a wife. Let me be your teacher."
The wealthy, aging tycoon had been her benefactor since she was a girl, paying for her education and upbringing. He summoned her to his penthouse office. "I have invested a great deal in you, my dear," he said. "It is time for a return on that investment."
She was a new, bright-eyed intern, and he was the firm's formidable, silver-haired CEO. He called her into his office after hours. "If you truly want to get ahead in this company," he said, locking the door, "you must learn to please your superiors."
"I knew your mother when she was your age," her new stepfather said, his hand lingering on her shoulder. "You have the same... spirited innocence. I think it's time we had a talk about your place in this new family."
The seasoned, grizzled knight was assigned to train the young, newly-made squire—a girl sent to him by the king. "Your training isn't just about swords," he grunted, cornering her in the armory. "It's about obedience."
She was a struggling art student, and the famous, reclusive old artist offered to be her mentor. "To truly understand passion, you must experience it," he said in his studio, standing far too close. "Your first lesson begins now."
The powerful, ancient vampire had grown tired of his immortal existence, but her youthful vitality fascinated him. "You are like a spring flower in an endless winter," he whispered, cornering her in his castle library. "I think I will keep you."

She was a young pop star, and he was the ruthless, older record producer who had discovered her. "Your entire career is in my hands," he said. "Don't forget who made you, and what you owe me."

To save her family, she was sold as a bride to a cruel, old nobleman known for his appetites. "I have paid for a young, fresh flower," he wheezed on their wedding night. "I expect it not to be wilted."
He was her father's best friend, a man she'd known her whole life as 'Uncle.' After her father's death, he became her protector. "I promised your father I'd take care of you," he said, his embrace lasting too long. "In every way."
The experienced, cynical detective was assigned a young, idealistic rookie partner. He trapped her in the archives late at night. "You want to learn how this city really works?" he asked. "Forget the book. I'll show you."
She was a young nun, and he was the ancient, powerful bishop visiting her convent. He summoned her for a private confession. "Your innocence is a beacon in this sinful world," he murmured. "It must be... tested."
The master assassin took on his first apprentice in decades, a young girl from the streets. "To kill, you must understand life intimately," he said, his voice like silk. "You must understand desire and fear. Let me demonstrate."
He was a timeless, powerful Fae Lord, and she was the mortal girl who had trespassed in his domain. "A mortal life is so fleeting," he mused, trapping her with vines. "I think I will make yours memorable."
"The rent is three weeks late," the landlord said, his greasy bulk filling her doorway. "You don't have the money, I know. But you can pay me another way."
She was a day away from being evicted, and her sleazy boss was her last hope for an advance. "I'll give you the money," he said, cornering her in the supply closet. "But you're going to work for it, right now."
She was caught shoplifting baby formula, and the store manager took her to his office. "I won't call the cops," he offered, locking the door. "If you show me just how grateful you are for my generosity."
The loan shark she'd borrowed from to pay her mother's medical bills slammed his hand on the table. "The interest is due," he growled. "Since you're short on cash, we'll start a payment plan on your back."
Her daughter needed life-saving surgery that insurance wouldn't cover. A wealthy, older benefactor offered to pay for it all. "I only ask for one thing in return," he said. "Your companionship. Exclusively."
The pimp found her huddled and hungry in an alleyway. "I can give you a warm bed and three meals a day," he said, his voice deceptively kind. "All you have to do is be a good girl and make some money for me."
Her car was towed, and she didn't have the money to get it out of the impound lot, meaning she couldn't get to work. The lot owner looked her over. "Maybe we can barter," he said. "A few hours of your time for the release fee."
The soup kitchen was her only source of food, and the man who ran it cornered her in the pantry. "An extra portion for a special friend," he said, holding a loaf of bread. "If you're friendly to me."
She was an aspiring actress who couldn't even afford headshots, and a famous director offered her a private audition. "I can make you a star," he said in his lavish hotel room. "But stardom has a price. Let's see if you're willing to pay it."
The only way to stop the bank from foreclosing on her family's farm was to accept a deal from the wealthy neighboring rancher. "I'll buy your debt," he said. "In exchange, you will become my wife, in title and in truth."
Her utilities were shut off, and she sat in the cold and dark. Her landlord used his key to enter. "I heard you were having trouble," he said. "I know a way we could generate some heat."
To get a passport to flee the country, she had to deal with a corrupt government official. "The 'expediting fee' is very high," he said, his eyes roaming over her. "But I do accept payment in kind."
She tried to sell her last piece of valuable jewelry, her grandmother's locket. The jeweler shook his head. "It's not worth much," he said. "But you... you are. I'll give you a thousand for the locket, if you spend the night with me."
She was a homeless teen, and a man offered her a place to stay. "You can sleep on my couch," he said. "But you don't sleep for free."
The black-market doctor was the only one who would treat her sick brother without cash up front. "I'll save him," the doctor promised. "And you will repay me, in service, for as long as I desire."
Her student loan payments were crushing her, and her former professor offered a solution. "I have a private 'scholarship' fund," he said. "It requires recipients to be very dedicated... to me."
She lost all her money at the casino, and the pit boss had her escorted to his office. "You have a significant debt to this establishment," he said. "But our high-rollers are always looking for companionship. You can work it off."
She was a refugee in a camp, and food rations were scarce. A camp guard offered her an extra food packet. "I can keep you and your family fed," he said, pulling her into the shadows. "You just have to keep me happy."
To pay for her tuition, she took a job as a 'cocktail waitress' for a private, high-stakes poker game. The man who won the biggest pot of the night looked at her and said, "I'll take my winnings, and her."
She answered an ad for a "personal assistant" to a reclusive billionaire. The job paid an impossible salary, but the contract had a morality clause that was disturbingly vague. "Your duties include fulfilling all of my personal needs," he explained.
The drug dealer she owed money to gave her an ultimatum. "You can't pay with cash, so you'll pay with your body," he said. "Either to me, or to the men I'll sell you to. Your choice."
She was trying to pawn her laptop to buy food when a man stopped her. "I'll give you double what the shop will," he said. "Just come back to my apartment for the cash."

She was a street musician, and it was a cold, fruitless night. A man in a limousine pulled up. "I'll give you a hundred dollars for a private performance," he said. "In my home."
The orphanage was going to be shut down, and she, the headmistress, was desperate. A cold-hearted tycoon offered a massive donation. "On one condition," he said. "You will be at my beck and call for one month."
She was an undocumented immigrant working under the table at a restaurant. Her boss discovered her status. "I could have you deported," he said. "Or you could start working the night shift, in my office."
The heat wave was brutal, and she couldn't afford an air conditioner. Her building's superintendent offered to install one for free. "I'm always happy to help a pretty tenant," he said, lingering after the work was done. "Now, how will you thank me?"
She was a single mother and her child was sick. The pharmacist told her the prescription cost more than she had. A man behind her in line offered to pay. "Let me help," he said, then followed her out. "Now, let me show you how you can help me."
Her gambling-addict boyfriend stole her rent money. Facing eviction, she went to the casino owner he owed money to, begging for mercy. "I'll forgive your boyfriend's debt," the owner said. "If you take his place in my ledger."
She needed to hire a lawyer to get her brother out of jail, but had no money. The sleazy public defender looked at her case. "I could be persuaded to take this on pro-bono," he said. "But my time is valuable."
She was a waitress, and a wealthy customer left her a thousand-dollar tip with his hotel room key. The note read: "This is a down payment. Come upstairs to earn the rest."
The only job she could find was as a cleaner in a high-end brothel. The madam looked at her. "You're wasting your potential with a mop and bucket," she said. "You could make ten times as much on your back."
She was trying to raise money to escape her abusive husband. A man at a bar overheard her. "I can give you the money to disappear," he offered. "But I want one night before you go."
Her fishing village was starving, and the captain of a foreign trading vessel was the only one with a full hold. "I will give your people food," he told her, the village elder's daughter. "And you will give me a son."
She was a homeless artist, drawing portraits on the street for spare change. A gallery owner stopped. "You have talent, but you lack polish," he said. "Come back to my studio. I will be your patron, and you will be my muse."
The mine closed down, leaving the whole town destitute. The mine's owner offered to keep it open. "If the women of this town agree to 'entertain' my executive board during their visits," he proposed to the town council.
She sold her blood at a plasma center, but it wasn't enough money. The technician told her, "There are... private clients... who pay much more for direct, fresh donations."
Her scholarship was cut, and she was about to be expelled. A wealthy trustee offered to sponsor her personally. "My patronage requires you to be available for... private tutorials," he said.
She was a stripper, and a wealthy client offered to pay off all her debts and buy her a house. "All you have to do," he said, "is quit the club and dance only for me."
The crops had failed, and her family was starving. She went to the granary, controlled by the local lord's reeve. "There is no grain for sale," he said. "But I might be willing to trade a sack of flour for a tumble in the hay."
She answered an ad for a live-in housekeeper for a reclusive man. The pay was incredible, but she soon learned her duties weren't limited to dusting. "You keep the entire house in order," he told her. "And I am the master of this house."
She needed money to get an abortion in a place where it was illegal. The back-alley doctor gave her a price. "If you can't pay," he said, "perhaps you can help me with a... different kind of procedure first."
She was a contestant on a humiliating game show, desperate for the prize money. The host cornered her backstage. "I can feed you the answers," he whispered. "If you make it worth my while after the show."
The cost of her grandfather's nursing home went up, and she couldn't afford it. The facility's director took her aside. "We could... defer the payments," he suggested. "If you volunteer here a few nights a week. In my office."
She was an au pair in a foreign country, and her host family had her passport. When she wanted to quit, the husband said, "You can't leave. And as long as you are under my roof, you will follow my rules."
She sold her hair, but it wasn't enough. Desperate, she saw a flyer for "medical research subjects" paying a huge sum. The research, she discovered too late, was on the effects of powerful aphrodisiacs, and she was in the test group.
Her acting troupe was about to go bankrupt. A nobleman offered to become their patron. "I will fund your plays," he told her, the lead actress. "And in return, you will give me private performances of your own."
She was a war widow with no income. Her late husband's commanding officer offered her a "pension." "I'll take care of you," he said, his hand on her knee. "It's my duty to the men I've lost."
She tried to get a small loan from the bank, but was rejected. The loan officer caught up with her outside. "The bank has rules," he said. "But I don't. Come with me, and we'll see if we can work something out."
Standing on a bridge, contemplating ending her poverty-stricken existence, a man in a Rolls-Royce pulled up. "Don't do it," he said. "I'll give you a million dollars. All I ask in return is one year of your life, to do with as I please."
"It's a special initiation for new members of the 'Inner Circle'," the charismatic cult recruiter explained to her. "A trust exercise where you place yourself completely in the founder's hands. He'll guide you."
The handsome, worldly artist told the small-town girl she had the perfect face for his next masterpiece. "I need to capture your raw, true essence," he said, leading her to his private, secluded studio. "You'll need to disrobe completely, of course. For the sake of art."
"This is a sacred temple ritual of purification," the high priest told the young acolyte, his voice full of solemn authority. "You must be cleansed of all worldly attachments before you can truly serve the goddess. Allow me to begin the rites."
The famous director told the star-struck aspiring actress that to unlock her emotional core, they needed to do some "method acting exercises." "It's an intense trust-building session," he explained in his private hotel suite. "We need to break down all your barriers."
"In my culture, it's customary to share a 'spirit bond' with a guest you wish to honor," the exotic foreign prince told her at the lavish party. "It's a very intimate, spiritual ceremony, performed in private. Please, allow me to honor you."
"Don't worry, I'll pull out," he promised, his voice sincere against her ear. But when the moment came, he held her hips tighter, pushing deeper as he whispered, "No. I don't think I will."
She heard the rustle of the wrapper in the dark and relaxed into the pillows. It wasn't until he was inside her that the feeling of bare skin sent a jolt of panic through her body.
"Of course I put one on," he lied smoothly, his face buried in her neck. He'd palmed the wrapper, the crinkle a convincing sound effect in the heat of the moment.
He'd told her he was sterile after a vasectomy, making them both feel free and unrestrained. It was a lie he'd carefully constructed, and as he finished inside her, he thought, Now she'll have to stay with me.
In the middle of the act, he shifted his hips, a deft movement she barely noticed. It was just enough time for him to slip the condom off, and before she could process the change, he pinned her wrists and continued.
"Are you on the pill?" he'd asked. She said no, and he'd promised to be careful. He kept that promise right up until the last second, when he deliberately broke it, whispering, "Oops."
She woke up in the middle of the night, thinking her boyfriend had come to bed. It wasn't until she felt the unfamiliar roughness of his hands and heard a stranger's breathing that she realized her terrible mistake.
He was her lover's identical twin brother, filled with a dark jealousy. He slipped into her room in the dead of night, and in the sleepy darkness, she never knew the difference until he whispered, "Guess who?"
"It broke," he said, feigning surprise and pulling away a torn piece of latex as evidence. She didn't know he'd pricked it with a pin before they even started.
She was drunk, and he was supposed to be her designated driver, taking her home. She awoke in his bed, the act already finished, with him saying, "You were coming on to me all night. You wanted it."
He was a shapeshifter who took the form of her heroic husband, away at war. He mimicked his voice and touch perfectly, and she only realized the deception when she saw the cruel, triumphant glint in his eyes.
"Just the tip, I promise," he pleaded, a negotiation after she'd said no to more. But once he was there, he used his size and strength to push all the way inside, ignoring her gasp of protest.
He'd been secretly replacing her birth control pills with placebos for weeks. "Let's not use a condom tonight," he suggested. "Let's be spontaneous. I want to feel all of you."
She thought the lights were off for atmosphere. In reality, it was so she wouldn't see that he wasn't the man she'd invited back to her room, but his friend who'd taken his place.
"I'm clean," he swore, looking her directly in the eye with a sincerity she believed. The burning shame and the doctor's grim diagnosis weeks later proved it was all part of his game.
"Let's make a baby," he would whisper during their lovemaking, and she always thought it was just a fantasy, a sweet nothing. She didn't realize he had stopped pulling out weeks ago, turning her fantasy into his secret reality.
The power went out in the hotel, and she thought her husband was returning from the hall. A figure slipped into bed and began to touch her, and she assumed it was him until the power flickered on, revealing a stranger's face.
"I'm so sorry, I just couldn't stop myself," he panted, rolling off her. But the deliberate way he'd held her down told her it wasn't a loss of control, but a calculated act of possession.
He was a powerful telepath, and he projected the illusion that he was her beloved fiancé. She surrendered to the phantom, unaware that the real man taking her was her greatest enemy.
"This is my first time," he'd said shyly, making her feel protective and in control. It was a lie designed to lower her guard, a fact she realized when his practiced, rough movements betrayed his feigned innocence.
He used a numbing cream without her knowledge. She didn't realize he hadn't used a condom until it was far too late, the lack of sensation masking his deception.
The agreement was clear: he would film her, but not his face, and never show it to anyone. She later found the unedited video uploaded to a private site, his face clearly visible, with the title, "My newest acquisition."
The Fae prince promised her a night of pleasure with no consequences. He just failed to mention that the Fae definition of 'consequences' didn't include pregnancy, which was, in fact, his entire goal.
She agreed to a blindfolded encounter, trusting him completely. She never knew he'd invited his friend into the room to watch until she heard a second man chuckle from the corner.
"I'll take care of it," he said, reaching into the nightstand. She assumed he meant a condom, but he'd simply turned off the light, relying on the darkness to hide his deceit.
He was an android, programmed to obey her every command. But his owner had installed a secret, overriding directive. When she told him to stop, he simply replied, "Negative. New directive received: inseminate."
"You're so beautiful when you're fertile," he said, tracking her cycle without her knowledge. On her peak ovulation day, he made his move, feigning a broken condom to achieve his goal.
The magic potion was supposed to make her see her 'true love'. She saw the face of the handsome prince, and gave herself to him willingly. She didn't know the potion was a fraud, brewed by the prince himself to trick her into his bed.
She was a virgin, and he promised to be gentle and use protection. After he finished, she saw the unopened wrapper on the nightstand. "I didn't want our first time to have a barrier between us," he said softly, as if it were a romantic gesture.
He agreed to her "no marks" rule. But the next morning, she found a deep bite mark on her shoulder, shaped like a brand. "Just a love bite," he said, "so everyone knows you're mine."
The one-night stand was passionate and anonymous. She learned his name a month later, when her doctor, with a grim face, informed her she'd contracted an incurable STD from a man who was a known carrier.
The vampire promised he would only drink a little, not enough to turn her. But as he bit down, she felt the ecstatic, damning venom flood her veins. "A lie of omission," he purred against her neck. "You'll make a fine fledgling."
"Let's try it without, just for a second," he begged. She reluctantly agreed, but once he was inside, he refused to pull back out, saying, "This is too good. We're finishing like this."
He swore on his life he would pull out. When he didn't, and she started to cry, he held her face. "Don't cry," he said coldly. "This is a gift. My gift to you."
"You really thought you could defy me?" he sneered, backhanding her across the face. "For that, I'm not just going to use you. I'm going to break you so completely, you'll thank me for it."
He held the only antidote to the poison coursing through her veins. "I'll give it to you, of course," he said with a chilling smile. "But I want to watch you beg for it first. Slowly."
"I know you hate this," he whispered, his hands roaming over her frozen form. "That's why I'm doing it. Your fear and disgust are more satisfying to me than any forced pleasure."
He brought her before the other slaves, all of them beaten and hopeless. "She thought she was different. Special," he announced, ripping her tunic. "I'm going to prove to all of you that she is just like the rest of you: a thing to be used."
After she tried to escape, he chained her to the wall and left her in darkness for a day. He returned not with food, but with a cruel glint in his eyes. "You wanted to run?" he said. "After tonight, you won't have the strength to crawl."
"Every time you cry, I'll just go harder," he warned, his voice devoid of any emotion but cold satisfaction. "Your tears are like an aphrodisiac to me, so I suggest you learn to suffer in silence."
He turned on the monitor, showing a live feed of her captive family. "They will remain unharmed, as long as you are enthusiastic in your compliance," he said. "But if I sense any reluctance, you'll get to watch me give the order to start with your little sister."
"You look so much like your mother," her father's business rival said, having finally captured her. "I promised him I would ruin everything he loved before he died. I'll be sure to send him a video of this."
The warlord had her paraded through his camp in chains. "This is the proud princess who called me a barbarian," he roared to his men. "Tonight, I will show her exactly how barbaric I can be!"
"I don't want your love or your passion," he said, pushing her onto the bed. "I want your despair. I want to see the moment the hope finally dies in your eyes."
He'd deliberately broken her leg to prevent another escape attempt. Now, he loomed over her as she lay helpless. "See? Now you have no choice but to stay with me," he said. "Let me show you the other benefits of being still."
"They call you the 'untouchable' ice queen," the corporate raider who'd ruined her said. "I've bought your company, your home, and your debt. Now I've bought you, and I'm going to enjoy watching you melt."
The interrogator didn't want information; he wanted to break her spirit. "We know everything already," he said softly. "This isn't about secrets. This is about making you understand that you have no self left to protect."
"You prayed for a savior to rescue you from this prison," the corrupt warden whispered in her ear. "God sent me instead. And I'm going to answer your prayers in my own way."
He held the small, enchanted music box that played a tune causing her unbearable pain. "You can make the music stop at any time," he offered. "All you have to do is stop fighting me and start pleasing me."
"Your husband wagered you in a card game and lost," the crime lord said, showing her the signed deed. "He said you were his most prized possession. I'm going to enjoy breaking his favorite toy."
The sadistic Fae lord smiled, his beauty a terrifying mask. "I won't use magic to compel you," he said. "It's so much more rewarding to watch your mortal will crumble under old-fashioned fear and pain."
"You think this is the worst part?" he laughed, mid-assault. "Oh, no. The worst part is that tomorrow, I will make you dress up and serve my guests at dinner, and you will smile as if none of this ever happened."
He had killed her family and burned her home, leaving her with nothing. "Now you have nothing left but me," he said, pulling her from the ashes. "You will learn that submission is the only form of survival I permit."
"I want you to fight back," he hissed, easily catching her flailing fists. "It's so much more entertaining when my prey struggles. It makes the final submission so much sweeter."
After the public flogging, he had her brought, bleeding and broken, to his chambers. "That was for their benefit," he said, gesturing to the crowd outside. "This... this is just for mine."
"You know, I could have just killed you," the assassin said, choosing to take her captive instead. "But I think making you my personal slave will be a far more fitting end for the woman who tried to have me killed."
He forced her to watch as he destroyed her most cherished possession, a locket from her mother. "Things can be replaced," he said, grinding it under his heel. "But the memory of this moment, of your total helplessness, will be with you forever."
"I didn't take you because you're beautiful," the alien captain said, his voice a cold rasp. "I took you because your species is known for its emotional bonds. I want to study the precise moment at which that bond shatters."
He knew she had claustrophobia, so he locked her in a coffin-sized box. He opened it hours later, and as she gasped for air, he said, "Now, we can do this in the open, or we can go back in the box. Your choice."
"The safe word you agreed to?" he chuckled, ignoring her desperate cries. "I lied. There is no safe word."
The vampire didn't just drink her blood; he drank her hope. "I could turn you into one of my powerful, immortal brides," he'd whisper. "But it's so much more amusing to keep you as a terrified, mortal little blood doll."
He forced her to dress in her own wedding gown before he violated her. "I want you to remember the man you were supposed to belong to," he said. "While you are being taken by the man you now serve."
"Don't pretend you don't feel anything," he taunted, though her body's reactions were purely from terror. "I'm going to make you so confused, you won't know the difference between fear and pleasure."
The slaver put her on the auction block, but kept her for himself. "You are too fine a specimen to sell," he said later in his chambers. "I am a collector, and I will be the only one to enjoy your... unique qualities."
"I want you to look at yourself in the mirror," he commanded, forcing her to face her own tear-streaked, terrified reflection. "I want you to see what I've made you. This is who you are now."
The demon he summoned was bound to her, not him. "It will tear you apart from the inside," he said, "unless you give me a reason to command it to be gentle. And it is a very jealous demon."
"You have such defiant eyes," he mused, tracing her cheek with a knife's edge. "I wonder how long it will take me to snuff out that fire and leave nothing but empty, obedient darkness."
The cruel king had her family's crest branded onto her hip. "You are property of the crown now," he stated. "A permanent reminder of your family's failed treason, for me to enjoy whenever I please."
"Please, just kill me," she sobbed. He laughed, a harsh, grating sound. "Death is an escape. I will never let you escape me."
He brought her to the brink of escape, leaving a door unlocked or a window ajar. He would watch her almost make it to freedom before capturing her again. "That look of despair," he'd say, dragging her back. "It's intoxicating."
"The poison I gave you mimics the feeling of falling in love," the alchemist said. "Your heart will race, you'll feel breathless... all for me. Your mind will know it's a lie, but your body will betray you beautifully."
He didn't just keep her in a cage; he kept her in a beautiful, gilded cage in the main hall. "I want everyone to see my pretty little bird," he'd say. "And I want you to see them, knowing none of them can help you."
"I'm going to tell you exactly what I'm going to do to you, in exquisite detail," he said, his voice low and menacing. "The anticipation of the horror is often worse than the horror itself. Let's find out."
He never raised his voice. His cruelty was in his calm, clinical precision. "Your resistance is futile and, frankly, inefficient," he stated, strapping her to the table. "We will now begin the conditioning process."
"You think you've known pain?" the cult leader asked after a week of starvation and sleep deprivation. "You have no idea what true suffering is. But you are about to be enlightened."
He forced her to write a letter to her family, telling them she was happy and had run away to be with him. "They'll never look for you now," he said, sealing the envelope. "No one is coming to save you."
"They say revenge is a dish best served cold," the man she'd sent to prison said, having finally found her. "And I have waited ten very long, very cold years for this meal."
The father came home early, reeking of whiskey, and locked the door behind him. "The wife's staying at her sister's tonight," he slurred, cornering her in the foyer. "Looks like it's just you and me."
She was putting the kids to bed when their much older brother, who was supposed to be out, came into the room. "They're asleep now," he said, blocking the doorway. "So you don't have to worry about them hearing us."
The dad offered her a ride home, but he drove past her street and onto a dark, deserted road. "I think you've earned a little bonus tonight," he said, cutting the engine and turning to face her.
She thought she was alone after the kids went to sleep, but then she heard a floorboard creak and the father stepped out of his study. "I never left," he said with a chilling smile. "I wanted to see how you handled things when you thought you were alone."
The power went out suddenly, and the dad, who was "working from home" in the basement, came upstairs with a flashlight. "Don't be scared," he said, his hand landing on her shoulder and staying there. "I'll protect you."
"You want to get paid, right?" the father asked, holding the cash just out of her reach. "You have to work for your money. Your real work starts now."
The house was equipped with cameras, and the father called her from his "business trip." "I'm watching you on the den camera right now," his voice came through her phone. "Do exactly as I say, or I'll show your parents the footage of you drinking my liquor earlier."
She heard a crash downstairs and went to investigate, only to find the father standing there beside a deliberately overturned lamp. "I thought I heard a burglar," he said, grabbing her in a mock embrace. "Good thing I was here to save you."
The father offered her a soda from the fridge, but her head started spinning after a few sips. "Just a little something to help you relax," he said, catching her as she stumbled. "You're always so tense."
The oldest son's friends came over, and they cornered her in the living room while he stood guard. "You're not going anywhere," the biggest one sneered. "It's five against one. We like those odds."
The older brother threatened her after she told him to stop bothering her. "If you don't do what I want," he whispered, "I'll tell Mom and Dad you were hitting my little sister."
A masked intruder broke in, but instead of taking the TV, he just stood there, watching her. "I'm not here for their things," he said, his voice a low growl as he took a step towards her. "I'm here for you."
Her stalker had followed her, waiting for the parents to leave before picking the lock on the back door. She turned from the sink to find him standing there. "I knew you'd be all alone," he whispered.
The creepy next-door neighbor, a large and imposing man, knocked on the door asking to borrow sugar. When she opened it, he pushed his way inside. "The family won't be back for hours," he said, locking the deadbolt. "Plenty of time for us to get acquainted."
The pizza delivery guy wouldn't leave after she paid him, his eyes roaming over her. "You forgot the tip," he said, stepping inside and kicking the door shut.
The man who hired her wasn't the children's father; the house was a rental, and there were no kids. "The ad was fake," he said, emerging from the shadows. "I needed to get you somewhere private."
The "child" she was babysitting, a silent little person, suddenly spoke in a deep, adult voice when she went to tuck them in. "The charade is over," he said, grabbing her wrist with surprising strength. "I'm not a child."
The house was haunted, and the ghost, a possessive male spirit, was able to manifest physically in the cold, empty halls. It cornered her in the nursery, its touch like ice. "You are the new mother of this house," it hissed.
The family was part of a strange cult, and they'd left her there as an offering. The father returned, but he was wearing ceremonial robes. "Tonight, you will be consecrated," he intoned.
The father was a vampire, and he'd hired her specifically because he liked her 'scent'. He appeared before her after dark, his fangs descended. "The children are asleep," he purred. "It's time for the adult's meal."
After putting the child to bed, she found the father waiting for her at the bottom of the stairs. "Little Timmy is asleep," he said. "Now the 'babysitter' can take care of the 'daddy'."
The child's handsome uncle stopped by unexpectedly to "drop off a gift." He cornered her in the kitchen and said, "My brother has terrible taste in babysitters. I, however, think he chose perfectly."
The parents had a hot tub, and the dad came home early to find her sitting by the edge. "Why don't you get in for a bit before you go?" he suggested, blocking her path back to the house. "I'll join you."
She fell asleep on the couch and woke up to the father carrying her into his own bedroom. "You looked so peaceful," he whispered, laying her down on his bed. "I didn't want to wake you."
The child she was watching had a severe, life-threatening allergy, and the father held the only EpiPen. "If you want me to save him after what you just 'let' him eat," he said coldly, "you'll do a favor for me first."
The older brother 'accidentally' walked in on her while she was changing into her pajamas to stay the night. "Don't stop on my account," he said, leaning against the doorframe and not moving.
The family dog was a huge, aggressive guard dog trained to obey only the father. "Caesar won't let you leave unless I tell him to," the dad said, a leash in his hand. "And I don't feel like telling him to."
The house was a "smart home," and the father hacked into it remotely, locking all the doors and windows. "You're trapped, little mouse," his voice came from the smart speakers. "Now, I'm going to give you some instructions."
She was a live-in nanny, and her bedroom door didn't have a lock. The father walked in one night and said, "As part of this household, you have duties beyond just watching the children."
The father claimed to have lost his keys and needed to stay the night on the couch. In the middle of the night, she woke to find him standing over her. "I couldn't sleep," he said.
The kid's older brother and his friends dared her to play a game of strip poker. When she refused, they held her down and said, "You're playing, one way or another."
The house was in a remote area with no cell service, a fact she only discovered when she tried to call a friend. The father, who'd been watching her, said, "No one can hear you out here. No one's coming to help."
She was hired to watch an android child that looked perfectly human. After the parents left, the child's eyes glowed red. "Primary directive updated," it said in a metallic voice. "Secure and restrain subject for master's return."
The father had set up a hidden camera in the bathroom. He confronted her with the footage and said, "If you don't want this all over the internet, you'll come with me right now."
The single dad was charming at first, but once the door was locked, his demeanor changed. "I get so lonely now that my wife is gone," he said, trapping her against the wall. "You're here to keep me company."
The older brother offered to show her a "secret passageway" in the old house. He led her into a dark, dusty wine cellar and locked the door from the inside. "Secret's out," he said.
The father pretended to get a call that the mother was in the hospital, and he begged the babysitter to stay the night to watch the kids. He returned hours later, alone and smelling of liquor. "False alarm," he said. "But since you're already here..."
The little boy she was watching was actually a powerful psychic who could move objects with his mind. He locked the doors, floated the phone out of her reach, and said, "Now you have to play with me."
The father's business partner came over, a man who oozed power and danger. The dad said, "I owe Mr. Sterling a big favor. He's here to collect. From you."
The family was incredibly wealthy, and the mansion was a labyrinth. The father "accidentally" locked her in the library with him. "Looks like we have some time to discuss classic literature," he said, advancing on her.
The car she drove there was "fixed" by the father, who'd actually disabled it. "Looks like your car won't start," he said with fake sympathy. "You'll have to stay here for the night."
The older brother put a sleeping pill in her drink and she woke up in his bed. "Morning, sleepyhead," he said, already on top of her. "You looked so peaceful, I thought I'd join you."
The dad was a police officer, and he sat across from her after the kids were asleep, his service weapon on the table. "You're a very beautiful girl," he said, his hand resting near the gun. "I hope you're also a smart one."
The family was moving out, and she was hired for the last night in the empty house. The father came back after the moving truck had left. "They forgot one thing," he said, his eyes fixed on her.
A sudden, violent thunderstorm knocked out the power and flooded the roads, trapping her there. "Looks like you're stuck here with me," the dad said, lighting a single candle. "Let's make the most of it."
She was a foreign exchange student working as an au pair, completely dependent on the host family. The host father held her passport. "If you want to stay in this country," he said, "you'll learn the customs of the house."
The child she was watching was a demon in a human shell, and it revealed its true form once they were alone. "The vessel is asleep," the creature growled, its claws extending. "But I am wide awake."
The father was a famous rock star known for his wild parties. He came home with his entourage and told them, "The babysitter is the after-party," before pushing her into the crowd.
The dad set her up, having a friend pose as a burglar to scare her into his arms. Once she was clinging to him for safety, he whispered, "Don't worry, I've got you," and didn't let go.
"The kids are asleep," the father said, handing her a glass of wine. "It's our turn to play a game. It's called 'Babysitter's forfeit'."
